          <p>I loved <a href="http://www.cyoa.com/" title="Choose Your Own Adventure Home">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books when as a kid. I consumed them pretty much non-stop until my hobbies expanded into gaming and programming.</p>

          <p>One of my readers recently asked how hard it would be to write simple text adventure games. It occurred to me that she was essentially describing a digital version of “Choose Your Own Adventure.” Then I started figuring out how I would write this kind of game in order to answer her question.</p>

          <p>I ended up sending her an email that said “You can do it” followed by several hundred words that really belonged in a tutorial. It would be better to put the information here than to clutter her inbox too much, I think.
By the way - if what you <em>really</em> want to do is create interactive fiction and you’re not interested in creating the game engine itself, I suggest you take a close look at <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/">Inform</a>. It is a remarkable system with its own custom language for creating your tales.</p>

          <p>Interactive fiction can be more straightforward than a lot of games, because the game author decides everything that can happen. The game we’re making here is even more straightforward than most interactive fiction, because we are only providing the user with narrow lists of choices.</p>

          <p>Our version of interactive fiction is going to consist of a bunch of scenes along with paths that can be taken in each scene. A path can lead to one of two things:</p>

<p>The user is shown a scene description and a menu of actions that can be done in that scene. When she selects an action, she is presented with the description and menu for that scene.

          <p>Okay - you’ve got the rough idea of what you want. You probably want to map the story out on paper before turning it into code, because that will make the task of programming it a lot easier. Let’s start with a really small story, say five scenes. Each scene has a description and a menu of paths to other scenes.</p>

          <p>We have scenes and we have a complete description of how the game works. This is more or less what they call a “specification,” because it specifies what the program will need to do. Specifications can become incredibly huge as your goals become more complex. Writing them is an art - you have to get all the requirements down on paper, but you also try to keep things short and sweet so that your development team will actually <em>read</em> them. It is even harder than that, because the requirements change as development continues. Yep - writing specs is hard, and I haven’t gotten the art down myself.</p>
