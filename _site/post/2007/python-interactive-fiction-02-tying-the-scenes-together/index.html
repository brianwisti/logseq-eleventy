          <p>This is the second part of <a href="/post/2007/interactive-fiction-with-python" class="page-link">post/2007/Interactive Fiction with Python</a>, about using <a href="/python" class="page-link">Python</a> to create interactive fiction.  I hope to show you one fun use of Python while teaching you more about the basics of this language.  We started by defining how our game was going to work and creating a set of scenes for play. In <a href="/post/2007/python-interactive-fiction-01-handling-a-single-round" class="page-link">post/2007/Python Interactive Fiction - 01 Handling a Single Round</a> we wrote the code to handle a single round of the game. Today we are going to tie all of our scenes together to make a complete, playable game of interactive fiction. We are going to approach it from an experimental view, playing with different approaches until we find one that makes us happy. Well, one that makes <em>me</em> happy.</p>

          <p><code>ifiction.py</code> already does a good job of describing a scene, but we want to describe any one of several scenes. That won’t happen unless we have an effective way to store all of the scenes and get at a specific one.  It’s immediately obvious that we can’t have a separate variable for each scene along with a separate list for each scene’s available actions. That will become clumsy far too quickly. Let’s think this through.</p>

          <p>Did you see that array just sitting there in the middle of <code>scene</code>? Arrays can hold anything, even other arrays. But why didn’t I declare an array variable to hold the paths? Well, the answer boils down to “why bother?” The array of paths doesn’t really have a meaning outside of the scene, so I don’t want to clutter up the names by adding a variable I will only use once. Why do I then go and declare a <code>path</code> array later on? To make it easier to use the paths of different scenes when that becomes an issue for me.</p>

          <p>Go ahead and try that code out. It still functions exactly the same. That’s good. You don’t want the whole thing collapsing just because you made one change. So, why did I keep <code>description</code> and <code>paths</code> instead of referring to <code>scene[0]</code> and <code>scene[1]</code> in this version? The answer is as easy as you think it is. No way am I going to remember that <code>scene[1]</code> refers to the paths for that scene. I kept the variable name because it’s easy to remember, and works the same regardless of what scene I use.</p>

          <p>Oh, that’s no good at all. Of course we can’t use <code>mountain_scene</code> before we tell Python what <code>mountain_scene</code> actually <em>is</em>. What are we going to do? We could make a handful of <code>None</code> assignments at the beginning of the code, but that fights against the flexibility of a language like Python. We could also create a big list called <code>scenes</code> and use the index of each scene instead of a variable name. That <em>would</em> work, but it’s inconvenient. Everything could break again if we change the number of scenes. We’ll also have to keep good notes in order to remember that <code>scenes[0]</code> is the “field scene”, <code>scenes[1]</code> is the “mountain scene,” and so on. Besides, do we really care what order the scenes are stored in? Everything should fall into place automatically once we decide what the starting scene is.</p>

You know how to use a dictionary, right? You want to know the meaning of a word, so you look it up by name, and there is the definition. The dictionary type works the same way. It uses <em>keys</em> instead of indexes. You look up values in a dictionary using their keys. Hey, we haven’t gone to the console recently, and now’s the perfect time.</p>

          <p>Python recognizes that you are creating a hash when you use the curly brackets <code>{}</code>. Your initial keys and values will go within those brackets, much like when creating a list. The items in a hash — sorry, they’re called dictionaries in Python, but hashes in many other languages. Dictionary is a much more sensible name, since it describes how you use it. Still, I do occasionally use the word “hash” instead of dictionary because I’m so used to it from other languages. I could have corrected myself and you never need know, but I thought it seemed nice to take a second and point it out. Now when you hear somebody talking about hashes in Perl or Ruby, you will already know that they are describing what you know as dictionaries.</p>

          <p>What was I saying? Oh, right. The items in a <em>dictionary</em> are pairs of keys and values. The bit on the left of the <code>:</code> character is the <em>key</em>, and that’s what we use to look up a value. The <em>value</em> is the item on the right, and that’s the bit you’ll usually cared about. The values are strings in this case, but they can be anything. Actually, the same thing is true for the keys, but string keys are the most common. I will definitely be sticking with string keys in the near future.</p>

          <p>Once you’ve defined your dictionary, use square brackets <code>[]</code> to get to individual values. This is similar to the way you get at values in a list. This little bit of consistency is provided because both lists and dictionaries are <em>collection</em> types, and it’s important to provide a consistent interface for similar tasks. The task in this case is accessing individual items in the collection.</p>

          <p>Using a dictionary is straightforward, as you can see. There is one quirk you need to be aware of, though. Remember how I said that dictionaries were a good collection type for those situations where the order of things collected doesn’t matter? That’s because you cannot assume that the keys in a dictionary have any kind of order.</p>

          <p>You can see that the keys are not in the alphabetical order you might expect. The reason is a little technical for my mood right now, but basically Python does a little preparation which makes it easier to store and access the keys later. The cost for us is that the keys look unsorted. It’s a small cost, and one that we can work around easily if it’s that important.</p>

          <p>Okay, fine. But what was I saying earlier about <em>methods</em>, and why does it look like I have a function call pressed up against <code>letters</code>? That is our first peek at Object Oriented Programming, a popular approach which makes a lot of programs easier to describe.</p>

          <p>I am having a hard time coming up with a description for objects, even though the basic idea is easy. You have been dealing so far with simple values for variables, like the number <code>3</code> or the string <code>&quot;bananagram&quot;</code>. Well, an object is <em>like</em> a simple value, but you can ask it to do things. Take a dictionary for example. You can ask it for its keys, you can ask it if it has a particular key, and a few other things. Many of those requests are done with <em>methods</em>. A method looks like an ordinary function, but it is associated with a particular type of object.</p>

          <p>We are now using key names instead of variable names. This makes Python happier, since we aren’t using variable names that haven’t been defined yet. There is a pleasant side effect, too. Instead of having half a dozen different <code>scene</code> variables, we have contained all of them in a single <code>scenes</code> dictionary. I like to think that this makes the code a little cleaner. We use a convenient name as the key for each scene. Each scene is a dictionary as well, containing the description and paths for that scene. And then the paths collection for each scene is an array of dictionaries. Each element of the <code>paths</code> list contains the destination and a phrase describing the command. *(I’m not comfortable with the</p>
