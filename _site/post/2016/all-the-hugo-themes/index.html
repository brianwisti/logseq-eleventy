          <p><a href="https://splinter.readthedocs.org">Splinter</a> provided the browser controlling API. Since I’m using Chrome for this, I installed the <a href="https://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/drivers/chrome.html">Chrome WebDriver</a>. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html">subprocess</a> standard library module allowed me to control Hugo, restarting with a fresh theme once the browser had enough time to grab a screenshot.</p>

          <p>Themes vary significantly in their expected configuration options. Some want social media links under <code>author</code>. Others wanted them in <code>Params</code>. <code>gravatarHash</code> and <code>GravatarHash</code> are two distinct options. Many have hard-coded assumptions in their layouts: an image file <code>/img/avatar.jpg</code>, for example. Sometimes it’s called <code>/media/me.jpg</code> though.</p>
