          <p>They follow directions from Charlene Schurch’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399836.Sensational_Knitted_Socks">Sensational Knitted Socks</a> with “Woven Stitch” as the repeating pattern. I used <a href="http://shoalwaterbayyarn.com/bamboo.html">Shoalwater Bay Bamboo/Merino yarn</a>, which I purchased a couple years ago at the Seattle University District Street Fair.</p>

          <p><em class="link-missing">Knitting</em> is detail work. You need to remember how many stitches you knitted, how many more you need to knit, and how far along the increases or decreases you are. I usually handle this by counting stitches constantly, getting bored, and loathing the fact that people have two feet because it means I need to knit a <em>second</em> sock. I often take months to finish a single pair of socks. Knitting two at the same time just confused me more — though I plan to tackle that eventually.</p>

          <p>I decided to log my work with the Amicable Socks. Part of that involved breaking down the generalized instructions into something specific for my chosen pattern.</p>

          <p>I also marked off rows as I finished them. I pondered tracking individual stitches, but realized that would result in too much detail to be useful.</p>

          <p>These socks took me six weeks to finish, significantly beating my previous record of 3 months. And that was with a week and a half of idle time while I worried about whether I had enough yarn to finish the pair.</p>
