<p>Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the  various methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a conference. Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace.</p>

          <p>“Good enough” isn’t good enough for every case, though. Occasionally you want to tune some of your content in a special way. You may find this is easier with collections than with blog posts.</p>

          <p>There are also dedicated sites for all of these ideas, and those are good enough too. Some excel at the services they provide. They have concerns too. Now the visibility of your creations is tied to the fortunes and policies of whoever provides that service.

          <p>I could use collections for my knitting and crochet projects. I have a couple of <em class="link-missing">Knitting</em> blog posts here. My <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/people/brianwisti">account</a> on <a href="https://www.ravelry.com">Ravelry</a> highlights a handful of other WIPs and FOs: <em>Works In Progress</em> and <em>Finished Objects</em>.</p>

          <p>The blog posts work fine as blog posts, but I still want a separate way to organize those projects. The stuff on Ravelry can only be seen if you have an account with the service. That’s fine, but I have spent 2015 consolidating material I’ve created elsewhere onto my site. Ravelry is a reasonable next target for me.</p>

          <p>First I need to add a <code>collections</code> entry to my <code>_config.yml</code>
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">configuration</a> file. This entry contains a list of all collections in the site, and metadata for each collection. I want these collections displayed on the site, so I must set the <code>output</code> metadata for the collection to <code>true</code>. I also want give consistent URLs for my project pages. This has been an issue for me bouncing between Jekyll 2.5.3 and 3.0.0 beta. Setting <code>permalink</code> takes care of that issue.</p>

I made this scarf as a quick break from all the socks I made or tried to make
over the last few years. The scarf pleased its new owner immensely, and she
wears it whenever the weather permits.

          <p>Jekyll sorts collections by filename. Since time finished matters to me now, I create a copy of the crafts collection sorted from most recently finished to oldest. Now I can step through that copy, only summarizing projects completed this year. Liquid may have an easier way, but I haven’t learned it yet.</p>
