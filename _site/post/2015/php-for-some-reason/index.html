          <p>Let’s blame <a href="http://funkatron.com/">Ed Finkler</a>. I started following him online because of his <a href="http://funkatron.com/osmi/">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> work and talks. He also talks about programming languages, and this exposed me to interesting things happening in the PHP world.</p>

          <p>Topping off the strange PHP interest: I registered for <a href="http://www.pnwphp.com/">Pacific Northwest PHP</a>, which will be held here in Seattle next month. Of course I’m looking forward to Ed Finkler’s talk, but several of the talks interest me.</p>

          <p>My last serious PHP code-writing project was six years ago. Even then it had been a long time since PHP was my primary development language. I’m curious to play with versions 5.6 and 7.</p>

          <p>I put together a <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead">Homestead</a> instance in Vagrant. The next step for me is probably the <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-bootcamp-in-php">laracast series on PHP objects</a>. It’s been long enough that I don’t remember what a PHP object looks like anymore.</p>
<p>And yes, I’m familiar with the <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP: a fractal of bad design</a> piece. I agreed with every point made in it. Some little bits have changed, but PHP is not Python. It never will be. But I’ve given up on hating PHP. PHP is a cockroach. The last Web servers will be running PHP. May as well poke at it a little bit. That’s the sort of thing I do.</p>
