          <p>I enjoyed importing the <a href="/coolnamehere" class="page-link">coolnamehere</a> content so much last weekend that I decided to import the posts from a neglected <a href="/blogger" class="page-link">Blogger</a> blog this weekend. <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/">jekyll-import</a> simplified the actual import process, though I still had a lot of manual cleanup to perform.</p>

          <p>The footer now includes links to <em>All Categories</em> and <em>All Posts</em>. The main category listing in the header was pared back down to the stuff I expect to update. I need to do something with the full post listing. It is unwieldy  now. Time to look up <em class="link-missing">Jekyll</em> plugins.</p>

          <p>I don’t know what to do with the material still hosted on Blogspot. Do I delete it? Do I make each post redirect here? I’ll figure it out.</p>

          <p>I looked at the number of visitors to that blog since 2006 — not many — and opted to delete it rather than spend any time messing with redirects.</p>

          <p>Why do this in the first place? I got bored of having pages I wrote more or less for myself being scattered here, there, and everywhere. It’s a little easier to remember what I’ve learned if I keep it in one place.</p>

          <p>I also have my old LiveJournal posts, but they may end up staying offline. They lack programming content and serve mainly as an insight into how profoundly depressed I was up to about 2009 or so. Not <em>especially</em> excited about reviewing that content at the moment.</p>
