          <p>All sorts of adults wondered what discoveries I could look forward to by the time I was their age. No idea how old they were. I was a kid. They were <em>ancient</em>. Let us say they were middle-aged.
I turned 43 in 2015 - statistically speaking, past the halfway point for someone like me. So that makes me middle aged. What do Pluto and  Charon look like now?</p>

          <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a>’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html">New Horizons</a> we know what Pluto and Charon look like up close. NASA made us a nice family montage photo.</p>

          <p>Okay “dwarf planet.” That blob on the outermost reach of my childhood solar system is now a dwarf planet with moons, a landscape, and thousands of Kuiper belt neighbors.</p>

          <p>I live across the street from a K-8 school. Some of those kids are about six years old. I wonder what discoveries they will see by the time they reach my age?</p>
