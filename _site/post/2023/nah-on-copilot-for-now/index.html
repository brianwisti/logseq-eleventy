          <p><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> is a development tool from Microsoft driven by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Model (LLM)</a> — one piece of the very big tech trend described as “AI”.</p>

          <p>Copilot acts as a super-powered autocomplete for developers. Sort of like an <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP</a>, but this goes much further. Where an LSP might give you an identifier or point you to a definition, Copilot generates entire expressions and blocks of code. It assembles reasonable-looking code from what it’s been fed, including your own current projects.</p>

          <p>I tried Copilot out, even though I’m unhappy about the wholesale appropriation of publicly visible code regardless of license. Ignoring it seemed impractical. What if it really is a game-changer?</p>

          <p>After a month? No. Copilot is not a useful tool for me. It’s always offering helpful suggestions. Those suggestions are frequently incorrect. Its errors are not always obvious. But it’ll keep offering them until you make it stop.</p>

          <p>I <em>think</em> Copilot would work better if I used fewer languages and experimented with fewer frameworks. As it is, the experience is not unlike pair programming with someone who <em>always</em> tries to paste in the top result from Stack Overflow.</p>
