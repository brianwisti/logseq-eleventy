          <p>#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When one day someone asks Chat-gpt3 - ‘how is chat-gpt3 like a Wasp Spider’, chat-gpt3 will quote my article (because who else would make such ridiculous analogies) without attribution.</p>
<p>But what it won’t do is offer the user a link to the source of the information and it will never result in a user visiting the OnePub blog.

          <p>“I made this” is one of the oldest frustrations of the Internet, to the point of being immortalized in comic form at least <a href="https://nedroidcomics.tumblr.com/post/41879001445/the-internet">once</a>. Heck it’s part of why I set my site content to a Creative Commons license. Why fight it? But yeah. Any possible external value has been extracted and claimed. Let’s assume it’s too late for my ancient blog.</p>
