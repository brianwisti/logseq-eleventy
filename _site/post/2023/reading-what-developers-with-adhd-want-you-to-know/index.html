          <aside class="quote"><header>quote</header><p>In fact, ADHD is an invisible disability, which is exactly what it sounds like: “a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities” (Invisible Disabilities Association). Plenty of forms of neurodivergence, including autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and learning differences can be considered invisible disabilities.</p>

          <p>It’s not in-depth or anything, but offers a little pushback to the “ADHD is a superpower” myth. That myth is handy for the occasional self-help pep talk — “I’m good enough. I’m smart enough. And gosh-darn it, this funky brain wiring is a superpower!” — but it’s not true. The self-awareness and arsenal of coping techniques like task automation can look impressive to the untrained eye.
Those only give roughly the same functionality as a normal person going about a normal day. And oh goodness if you’re in a context where those techniques aren’t helpful? You’ve got unpartitioned tasks with a poorly defined goal that is important and kinda urgent, but stretched over months?[^3] The floundering.</p>
