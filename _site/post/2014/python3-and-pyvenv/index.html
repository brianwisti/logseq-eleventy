          <p>I have been spending much of my coding time in <a href="/python" class="page-link">Python</a> recently. This site is built in <a href="/pelican" class="page-link">Pelican</a>. Many lines of Python have been written for work. I have even been poking at <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/">Google App Engine</a> in what spare time is available. The only disappointment is that all of these have been in Python 2. I would prefer to be using <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3">Python 3</a>. There is a little free time today, so I will set up a nice Python 3 workspace.</p>

          <p>One of the interesting things about Python is how it handles personal workspaces. Popular tools in other languages, such as <a href="http://rbenv.org/">rbenv</a> for <a href="/ruby" class="page-link">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> for <a href="/perl" class="page-link">Perl</a>, focus on a complete localized installation for any version you care to use. Python tools assume a system standard version, and focus on making a snapshot for your projects. That works <em>sort of</em> like <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>. Once you have your snapshot loaded, you use <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/">pip</a> to install the exact libraries needed by your projects. That works very much like Bundler.</p>

          <p>The tool of choice for making virtual environments in Python 3 is <a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/venv.html">pyvenv</a>. pyvenv actually comes with the standard installation of Python 3.3 or greater. That is good news. Python 2’s <a href="http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/">virtualenv</a> was not hard to install, but it was not available by default. You still had to <em>install</em> it.</p>

          <p>There is already an excellent <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-and-using-virtual-environments">introduction</a> to using pyvenv. That tells most of what you need to know.</p>

          <p>Now <code>my-project</code> holds the default Python interpreter until you exit that particular shell or activate a different virtual environment.</p>

          <p>That is good enough to get started, but I often have several projects going. Each project gets its own virtual environment. Having my environment files just sitting there in my project folder bothers me, though.</p>

          <p>I like things tidy, so I use <a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">virtualenvwrapper</a>. virtualenvwrapper creates a single folder to hold your virtual environments and provides you with a couple of shell commands to manage those environments. It’s easy if you’re only using a single system Python. Just follow their installation <a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html">instructions</a>. After that, <code>mkvirtualenv</code> and <code>workon</code> are your friends.</p>

$ workon mypy3
(mypy3) $

          <p>What if I wanted to use both Python 2 and Python 3 virtual environments? Well, the virtual environments I already had set up for work function without any problem. Thank goodness. If I wanted to do new Python 2 work - well, that may be a good time to pull up a <em>real</em> virtual environment with a tool like <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. I may come back to that later.</p>
