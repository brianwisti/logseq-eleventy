          <p>I had a clever idea a couple months ago: to write a blog post detailing how to find recursively find duplicate files in a folder. My technique was good enough: track file sizes, find files that had the same file size and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#MD5_hashes">MD5 hash</a>, and display the resulting list. It wasn’t foolproof, but it showed some thought. After spending a little too much time on the post, I realized I had never checked <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Of course there is already a <a href="/perl" class="page-link">Perl</a> module to handle that exact task.</p>
