          <p>Today I got to take part in a User Experience Research interview with some fine folks from GitHub. It was straightforward. We chatted for about half an hour, mostly discussing GitHub. Makes sense. They learned how I used it. Since there is so little of GitHub that I use, they got to show me some nifty things.</p>

          <p>Like the <a href="https://github.com/explore">“Explore”</a> link up in the nav bar, for example. Any site’s “explore” link is generally useless, and often insulting - little more than a collection of paid promoted links. By 2014 I have learned to ignore the urge to explore. Turns out the GitHub “Explore” is somewhat nifty. Maybe just for me. Anyways. It is a collection of potentially interesting categories of projects hosted on Github, followed by your basic trending / starred-by-folks-you-follow / starred-by-staff blocks. I liked it. I was surprised.</p>

          <p>They also told me about <a href="https://guides.github.com">GitHub Guides</a>, a more explicitly useful link. Check it out. Documentation, pretty pictures, good habits. Lots of stuff in there.</p>

          <p>There were other things, but those two items are what stuck in my head.</p>

          <p>I told them the heavy emphasis on social interaction is what distinguishes Github from similar services. I also said I wanted to use that aspect more. So I followed them.</p>
