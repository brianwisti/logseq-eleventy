          <p>Much of what I’ve read about <a href="/org-mode" class="page-link">Org Mode</a> has focused on its utility as a task management tool. That’s great. I wouldn’t mind spending some time on that aspect. Mostly I’ve been focused on its usefulness for note-taking and writing.</p>

          <p>Org mode includes features which make it attractive for blogging and journaling. It has a relatively simple set of markup rules for common constructs such as paragraphs, <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Plain-lists.html">lists</a>, <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Working-With-Source-Code.html">source code</a>, and <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html">tables</a>. The mode itself provides an editing interface which simplifies creating and managing those constructs. Most importantly for the blogger, org files can be exported to a range of formats including Markdown and HTML.</p>

          <p>Why not use that functionality for my own site? Random Geekery is built with <a href="/jekyll" class="page-link">jekyll</a> , and there are already <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html">instructions</a> available for using the two together. I can use those as a starting point.</p>

          <p>When I’m using Org mode to write the blog pages, Jekyll becomes an implementation detail specific to publishing the blog. One folder contains all of the Jekyll project files, and an <code>org</code> folder mirrors the content-specific structure of the <code>jekyll</code> tree.</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">front matter</a> used by Jekyll and other engines to determine content metadata requires some special handling to get exported correctly by Org mode. The most straightforward thing is to use the suggestion from the instructions mentioned earlier. Put your front matter in a HTML block right at the top of the file.</p>
