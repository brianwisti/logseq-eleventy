          <p>Found out about a talk from Ryan Davis at Cascadia RubyConf because of an <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2012/08/ryan-davis-you-are-idiot-liar-or-fool.html">incensed reaction</a> to it from Giles Bowkett on <em>his</em> blog. Thing is, I like the talk. I even like the bits that Bowkett doesn’t. Of course, I wasn’t one of the folks specifically mentioned, and he was. So there’s going to be a different perspective there.</p>

          <p>But I could have been. Heck, I tried my hand at cute ranty posts a few years back, and one of them threw what I thought was a light hearted jab at Ryan.  But it really bugged him. He told me so the next time I logged into IRC, much later. I could see why it would when I looked back at the post and imagined it without context. The joke wasn’t even that funny <em>with</em> context. Our posts on big or little blogs - or social networks, for that matter - have a reach far beyond what we might think when we’re sitting at the keyboard. They can span the globe in a split second, and still be out there for years.</p>

          <p>On revisiting the forgotten joke, I saw that it could be considered offensive if you weren’t in the unique garden of my brain. I was really shaken by the fact that somebody I had such respect for (the guy is basically a genius in Ruby and other domains) had taken a lasting offense to something that I’d long forgotten about. So I cleared the post and got into the habit of checking myself before wrecking myself.</p>

          <p>I don’t mind if someone somewhere thinks I’m a jerk. I want it to be for a better reason than me pretending to be an insult comic, though.</p>

          <p>So, yeah. The guidelines mentioned by Ryan Davis for tending to the community are great, but it wouldn’t do any harm to use them as guidelines for tending yourself. You know: “Don’t be a dick!”</p>
