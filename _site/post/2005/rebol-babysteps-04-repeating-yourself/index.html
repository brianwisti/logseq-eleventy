          <p>Now we know how to do things, and we know how to choose whether or not we will do something. We’re getting close to having some real skills with <a href="/rebol" class="page-link">REBOL</a>. We just need to get the understanding of one more concept before we reach the first little plateau of programming knowledge. We need to learn how to do a task more than once. Well, besides just running the script again, but that doesn’t really count.</p>

          <p>Nothing fancy is going on here. We just <code>loop</code> through the question and answer process a few times, keeping track of the user’s correct answers. <code>random/seed now</code> is necessary to get  something close to what we would consider random. If we don’t provide it, then we get a specific sequence whenever we call <code>random</code>. Try commenting out the <code>random/seed</code> line and run the program a few times.

          <p>I’m only telling you this because I can see that one or two of you really want to know. What if you want to run a loop forever? Well, you don’t want to. Maybe you want to run a loop until some signal is received, or the user wants to quit, or something sensible like that. You don’t want a loop to run forever. But that doesn’t mean you <em>can’t</em> run a loop forever. REBOL provides us with the <code>forever</code> word to let us do exactly that.</p>

          <p><code>repeat</code> works almost exactly the same as <code>loop</code>. The main difference is that it stores the number of trips you’ve taken through the loop in a variable that you can get to from inside the loop. The variable has a value of <code>1</code> on the first trip through, <code>2</code> on the second trip through, and so on.</p>

          <p>We can’t do <em>that</em> with a <code>repeat</code> loop. At least, I don’t think we can. We set the starting bill at <code>$10</code>, and moved up to <code>$20</code> by <code>$1</code> at a time, showing the bill and corresponding average tip. It’s still a very small thing. The fact that it recognizes the values as money and treats it appropriately is a special thrill for me. If you haven’t programmed before, then you might just assume that things are supposed to work like this. You would be right. Things <em>should</em> work like this: transparent, and the obvious stuff should do the obvious. But in C, there would be all sorts of chaos and <code>printf</code> madness and general ugliness that would get you so angry that you might not even bother leaving a tip.</p>

          <p>Then there are the times when you aren’t sure exactly when you’ll need to stop. You need to keep going until it’s time to stop, basically. Now, you could use a <code>forever</code> loop and <code>break</code> whenever you need to stop. But I don’t want you to do that. Why am I so opposed to an approach like that? It comes down to clarity. Somebody will be reading your code a few weeks, months, or even years after you write it. That person could be you.
Don’t laugh - I’m still haunted by a script that I wrote years ago when I was first learning Perl. I thought I’d just be throwing that script away, but I still use it. I still cringe every time I have to read it, too. And yes, it had a couple of <code>forever</code>-style loops. I want to save you from the embarrassment of bad code whenever possible.</p>

          <p>But I digress. Let’s look at the conditional loops. There are two main conditional loops, <code>until</code> and <code>while</code>. The difference between the two from our perspective is when they test to see whether it’s time to quit the loop.</p>

          <p>The <code>until</code> loop tests at the end of each step of the loop. If the block returns true, then it’s time to quit. How do you know if the block returns <code>true</code>? Because the block returns the value of the last statement in the block. This means that we could put a simple test as the last statement, using the guidelines from <a href="/post/2005/rebol-babysteps-03-making-decisions" class="page-link">post/2005/REBOL Babysteps - 03 Making Decisions</a>.</p>

          <p><code>while</code> takes a test block and a loop block. There’s all sorts of clever things we can do in the test block, but for now we’ll just put simple tests in it. If the test comes up false, then <code>while</code> doesn’t bother running through the loop. If it’s true, then it runs through the loop and tests again.</p>

          <p>The last form of repetition is iterating through a list. A copy of each item in the list is passed to a temporary variable that you can play with in the loop block. I will only look briefly at this form of repetition in this chapter, because list manipulation and iteration is a big topic in its own right. Nevertheless, many of you will want to do <em>something</em> with lists before I get around to writing that next chapter.</p>

          <p>The basic list iteration function is <code>foreach</code>. It takes a name, a list variable, and a block. <code>foreach</code> repeats the loop once for each item in the list. The name is set to the value of the current item in the list. It is easier to demonstrate a <code>foreach</code> loop than it is to describe one.
Here’s a quick example.</p>

          <p>Naturally, your results may vary. In fact, they will almost definitely vary unless you read this article the day I updated it or your clock is set wrong. I encourage you to play with this script and come up with your own variations. How about a script that asks the user for a date and tells how far that day is from today? You’ll probably need to use <code>to-date</code> on the user input.</p>

          <p>Completing this chapter means you have hit a significant milestone in programming by learning all of the basic elements of something called “Structured Programming”. It is now possible for you to build non-trivial, “real-world” programs using REBOL. I will try to keep this in mind when putting together future chapters in this tutorial.</p>
