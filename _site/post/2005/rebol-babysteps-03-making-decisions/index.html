Let’s continue learning how to program with Rebol. Today I want to get you started with some structured programming by introducing you to selection structures. Selection structures make it possible to decide whether or not to do something based on a test. Here are a few uses for a simple selection structure.</p>

          <p>The simplest selection structure is <code>if</code>. You give it a <em>test expression</em> and a <em>block</em>. If the test expression turns out to be true, then REBOL runs the block. Otherwise, it ignores the block and moves on to the next statement.</p>

          <p>Those two equal signs in there combine to make a special <em>operator</em> that REBOL uses to test for strict equality – making sure that the thing on the left has exactly the same value as the thing on the right. There are a number of comparison functions and operators in REBOL. It’s up to you whether you prefer to use the function approach or the operator approach. My own preference varies according to my mood and the things being compared. Numbers and strings often get the operator treatment, while I lean towards using the functions for more complex things. I’ll stick to using the functions today, because that’s the sort of mood I’m in.</p>

          <p><code>equal?</code> doesn’t care about case. “abc” and “ABC” are the same, according to these tests. So are <code>1</code> and <code>1.0</code>. This is the way most of us think about comparisons, but programs sometimes need more careful comparisons in situations where case matters. One example that immediately comes to mind is login and password entry. You need to use <code>strict-equal?</code> or <code>strict-not-equal?</code> if you need an exact test.</p>

          <p>What happens if you want to do one thing if a test is true, but a <em>different</em> thing if the test is false? Let’s say, for example, we want to print out one message if we recognize the user as a master, and print out another message if the user is not a master. Well, I suppose you could have two <code>if</code> statements, like this:</p>

          <p>The <code>either</code> command requires a test expressions and two blocks.

          <p>Now is a good time to point out how flexible REBOL can be. Let’s reexamine our code and see what we are trying to do. We are printing a message, right? The only thing that is different is <em>which</em> message we are printing. We could hand the entire <code>if</code> statement directly to the print command like this:</p>

          <p>It accomplishes the exact same thing as we did with the original <code>either</code> statement, but removes a little bit of repetition. Some folks think that steps like this do a lot to make program code more readable. Another approach might be to assign the result of the <code>either</code> statement to a variable and then print the variable. I like this approach, because my program might grow later on. I might decide that I want the program to <em>speak</em> the response rather than print it out to the screen.</p>

          <p>There will be times that you want to check several things, and execute if any of them are true. Fortunately REBOL is there to help us with the <code>any</code> function. <code>any</code> takes a block of tests and returns true if any of those tests are true. This is another one of those definitions that just repeats the obvious, isn’t it? Well, a lot of predefined words in REBOL work like that.</p>
