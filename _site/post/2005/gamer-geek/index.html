          <p>I am a geek. I am a gamer. I am a gamer geek. Nobody should be surprised by either fact, and the people who really know me are amused that it has taken me this long to come out of the closet as not just a geek, but a <em>gamer geek</em>. What’s the difference? Well, it’s subtle, but here’s what I have so far.</p>

          <p>Role-playing games are fun. Maybe not for you, but I dig them. Not just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050207054757/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/">D &amp; D</a>. Nosirmaamorthing, I crave more from my games. Consistency. Quality. The opportunity to lord my feelings of elite superiority over people who only play D &amp; D.</p>

          <p>Really, there’s nothing at all wrong with D &amp; D. It’s a great game. I just happen to enjoy other games more - mainly because I’ve played them more. I also generally prefer games with a point system to games with a level system. What games? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050207054757/http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/">GURPS</a> is nice. I’ve enjoyed GURPS for a long time. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050207054757/http://www.herogames.com/">Hero</a> system is pretty damn cool, too. It’s better oriented towards high-powered superhero type games, but it can work for a lower power heroic setting. The point system for Hero is a little more straightforward than GURPS, too.</p>

          <p>Do you see how quickly I wander into the realm of gaming arcana? This is despite the fact that I haven’t actually <em>done</em> any serious gaming in years <em>(props to the neverending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050207054757/http://www.worldofdarkness.com/">World of Darkness</a> campaigns and the boy mage who had Cockroach as his avatar)</em>. And I could easily get worse.</p>
