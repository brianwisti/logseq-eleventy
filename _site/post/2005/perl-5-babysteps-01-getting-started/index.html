          <p>POD, or “Plain Old Documentation”, is the standard system for documenting Perl programs. POD directives exist within your application, but are ignored during execution. They are instead processed by the <code>perldoc</code> application. <code>perldoc</code> can convert your POD to different formats such as HTML, or simply format and display the documentation to your screen. Use POD to write about what you want <em>users</em> to know about your Perl application. A proper introduction to <code>perldoc</code> is far beyond the scope of this little tutorial, but you can see the potential usefulness of this tool from the console with a simple command:</p>

          <p>On each line, everything from <code>#</code> to the end of the line is a <em>comment</em>. Perl ignores comments, so they allow you to communicate with other people who read your code. Comments are <em>good</em>. When you come back to look at a complex script after a few months, you might forget what some block of code does, or why you chose one solution over another. Having the comments there help to remind you what you were intending, and generally serve to make it much easier sorting everything out.</p>

          <p>The <code>use</code> statement is incredibly powerful. It effectively changes the way Perl will behave for the duration of your program. You can get extra functionality with <code>use</code> by loading a module, or you can significantly change the rules Perl runs under by loading a <em>pragma</em>. I will be taking full advantage of the <code>use</code> statement in this tutorial, because it takes Perl from a strong shell scripting language to an incredibly powerful programming language.
Oh, about that semi-colon (<code>;</code>): <code>perl</code> uses the semi-colon to separate statements. Each statement contains a particular instruction for the Perl language. You will usually - but not always - see Perl code with one statement per line, with a semi-colon at the end of each line.</p>

          <p><em>Strings</em> – scalar values intended to be handled like simple text – are always quoted in some way to show where the text of the string begins and where it ends. There are many ways to quote a string, but for now I will use double-quote characters. That is what quoted text looks like in American English, so it is easy for me to remember. It also provides some other conveniences when displaying variables, such as when we say <code>&quot;Hello, $name&quot;</code> later in the program.</p>
