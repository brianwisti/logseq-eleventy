          <p>One thing you like to keep track of on your laptop is how much juice is left in your battery. There’s nothing quite like being in the middle of some insane hacking session and watching as the computer suddenly gets tired and blacks out on you. Of course, I’ve already got a handy battery monitor in my <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> panel, but what if I’m not in KDE? Okay, okay, there are handy battery monitors for nearly every desktop environment out there. That’s not my point, though.
My point is that I’d like to explore some basic system stuff using REBOL on an <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 8.10 system. Got it? Okay, good. Now that we’ve settled this little detail, let’s move on.</p>

          <p>Text is like water in UNIX-type systems. It is everywhere, and nearly everything can be accessed as a text file. Linux follows this ideal by keeping system information in a number of files in the <code>/proc/</code> directory. I could probably find everything I might want to know about the system in that directory, but let’s just focus on the directories which contain battery information.</p>

          <p>This is a lot longer than the Perl version, but you could argue that it’s easier to read. And I just <em>know</em> that there’s a better way to do it. Sadly, we won’t know what the better way is until we learn a little more about how Parse works.</p>

          <p>I’ll come back to that issue after I’ve learned a little bit more about Parse. For now, let’s focus on the fact that we are finally getting to the data. That means we have reached a milestone, and it also means we can stretch our legs for a minute. Good circulation is important, after all. Let’s refactor before we move on.

          <p>You aren’t supposed to change the actual functionality during refactoring, because the whole idea is to make it do exactly the same thing it did before, but in a more sane style. I was hit by a lightbulb moment while refactoring the <code>parse</code> rule, though, and decided to see what would happen if <code>skip</code> would get me past that colon. Sure enough, that did the trick!</p>

I prefer to see this in terms of what percentage is remaining. A full battery has 100%, and an empty battery has 0%. Seems easy enough, but we don’t have the total capacity listed in the state file.

          <p>Wow, I really don’t know what those numbers mean. We could fake it until we get a result that looks like what I see when I scrub the mouse over my KDE battery applet. I think I will do a little bit of searching on the Web, though. There is probably some sort of reference to the ACPI state files.</p>

          <p>I have a rule not to spend more than fifteen minutes looking something up online, unless the end result of such a search would be money or finding something that pleases my wife. This is neither, and I’ve just spent fifteen minutes making a few clumsy stabs at finding a reference for the ACPI state file. No luck, so let’s go with the faking it.</p>

          <p>The KDE panel says I have a little over two hours left on my laptop. With a couple of quick hacks, my script more or less agrees with KDE. There’s an occasional difference of a minute or two, but that is not an urgent issue for something like this. I would be much more concerned if this script was going to be used in a production environment, or in an environment where being off by a couple of seconds could cost somebody their life. On the other hand, what are they doing using some script they cobbled off the Web to keep their loved ones alive? And then they’ll probably get mad at <em>me</em> when it goes wrong. I swear, some people are just too strange for words.</p>

          <p>What? Oh, right. Here’s the finished version of the utility. Took me a couple of hours, but a lot of that was me learning the basics of <code>parse</code>.</p>

          <p>Running it shows a problem on Ubuntu. The discharge rate in the state file is listed as zero, which means the script has no way to determine estimated time remaining.</p>

          <p>Now, if I wanted to make this readily accessible from the command line, which I do, then I would just copy <code>laptop.r</code> to someplace on my path. I might even rename to something like <code>check-battery</code> without the “.r” suffix, to make it look more like any old command. This is a common maneuver on the command line. Many of the commands you use every day in the shell are just thinly disguised scripts, written in one language or another.</p>

          <p>This project was an exercise to see how difficult it would be to create a relatively simple utility. It was a challenge until I started getting the hang of Parse. I think Parse is easier to understand than regular expressions, but regular expressions have the advantage that they are familiar to more Linux developers. Still - get Parse out of the way, and creating useful applications in REBOL suddenly becomes very easy.</p>

          <p>There are a number of different things you could do to enhance or refine this script. Here are a couple of ideas.</p>

        
      

      
  
    
      
        
  
    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>This script is <em>not</em> portable. It assumes that you have the same file setup as my HP notebook running me version of Ubuntu. Any differences brought on by different distributions or operating systems are unaccounted for. You might want to alter the script to look in the right places for your machine.</p>

        
      

      
  

    </section>
  

      
    
  
    
      
        
  
    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>The script is <em>not</em> robust. What happens if there’s a zero in the wrong place, or ACPI can’t figure out what the rate of discharge is? I don’t know, but it’s probably not something good. You might want to make it more robust by checking for possible errors.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>Hey, what about writing this as a View application? Yeah, you could make a cute little picture of a battery that empties out as the remaining power drops. Why stop there? You could implement a whole system monitor, like <a href="http://gkrellm.net/">gkrellm</a>. That might be fun.</p>
