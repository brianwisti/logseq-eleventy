          <p>I decided to buy Rebol/Pro from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060811053620/http://www.rebol.com/">RT</a> this week, more to help pay for a few more hours of Rebol development than anything else. But hey, guess what? Rebol/Pro comes with a few bonus items that aren’t in basic Rebol/View. So I asked around and put together a quick overview, listing the add-ons and providing links to the documentation for these new items.</p>

          <p>I’ve just purchased Rebol Pro, but I didn’t really know where to find information on the specific features which are enabled. I asked at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060830144715/http://reboltalk.com/forums/">reboltalk</a> forums, and they gave me enough information to start this page. Thanks, folks!</p>

          <p>What does your $99 US get you? I’ve summarized it below for my own good, but you can also look at a few pages on the Rebol site for the official details:</p>

          <p>Now you can use the <code>call</code> function, which provides execution access to the other programs that have been installed on your computer. This makes a lot of tasks much simpler, as any shell scripter can tell you. I’ve had a lot of fun using the shell access features in Pro, and it’s made this a fair degree more useful at work. And it was pretty handy before!</p>

          <p>Looks like shell access is part of Core with the latest releases. That’s good, because I felt a little silly paying for it.</p>

          <p>Rebol/Pro can link to external libraries. Like what? I guess the possibilities are nearly endless. It’s all a little blurry to me, although I hope to figure out the Library stuff someday. For the meantime, there is a nice-looking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060830144715/http://www.rebol.org/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/rebol/view-script.r?script=opengl.r">OpenGL example</a> at <a href="http://rebol.org">rebol.org</a>. Hm. Looks like that one doesn’t work under Linux. It’s got a generous license, though, so an ambitious hacker could probably strip out the Win32 dependencies without making anyone angry.</p>

          <p>In case you need to, you know, encrypt things. Or make keys. Here is another topic that I don’t know much about. I’ve got a fine user perspective - make a key, use <code>ssh</code> or <code>scp</code>, don’t trust a site that doesn’t use <code>https</code> for the money part of its transactions, stuff like that. But now I guess I have something else I should learn about. Encryption is a major requirement for usability in a larger team or for services offered to the public.</p>

          <p>The availability of sound can add a rich dimension to your View applications, and make it easier to write simple games. Okay, so maybe sound isn’t <em>such</em> a big deal, but it’s a nice little add-on to have.</p>
