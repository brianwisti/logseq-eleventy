          <p>If you have never programmed before in your life, then do I have the perfect programming language for you. It’s called <a href="/python" class="page-link">Python</a> , and it is easy to learn, flexible, and loaded with capabilities that you never thought would be so easy to use. Imagine your thrill when you write a complete program in just a few lines!</p>

          <p>If you have spent years programming Perl, and are just about sick of all of the weird little context dependencies — “My function does this when you hand it a single object, and that when you hand it a list, unless you are assigning the result to a list, in which case it does this other thing” — then do I have the perfect language for you. It’s called Python, it has clear, unambigous syntax, and it is simple to create your own modules and objects. Imagine your thrill when you write a  complete program in just a few lines, and somebody else can read it!</p>

          <p>Which one you install is mostly a personal choice. The language itself is the same as long as you’re looking at the same version number, regardless of where you download it from. The main differences are the type of support you can get, and the tools that they come packaged with.</p>

          <p>The ActiveState version has the benefit of being from a real, live company. You can purchase support and take advantage of the fact that it comes from a single source. It — the Windows version, anyways — comes with the excellent PythonWin program for developing your Python programs in a Windows environment. Because of the support and the Windows-friendly tools, ActivePython may be the best choice for business users. It’s the version that I’m using for testing the tutorial in Linux, so maybe that has some bearing on your decision.</p>

          <p>Python 2.6, on the other hand, is the “official” version. It comes with a standard set of tools which are available on every platform that Python can support. Instead of PythonWin, Python 2.6 comes with IDLE: a cross-platform graphical environment for developing your Python programs. IDLE works pretty much the same for you whether you are sitting in front of Windows, Linux, or OS X.</p>

          <p>Your distribution probably has some version of Python available, but I prefer to get mine from <a href="https://activestate.com">ActiveState</a>. It’s easy enough to install, and is usually more up-to-date than what ships with most Linux distributions. There are also fewer concerns about figuring out whether you installed the <code>idle</code> or <code>pydoc</code> packages. You just install ActivePython and get to work.</p>

          <p>Recently, the kind folks who run the <a href="https://python.org">python.org</a> site have started making links to the latest Windows Python download from their front page. So, even though the stuff I said before is still true, now you can just look at the menu on the left side of the <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a> front page for “Quick Links &gt;&gt; Windows Installer”.</p>

          <p>Windows will ask you if you want to save the file or run it directly from the site. That’s up to you. If you have the disk space, and know how to find and run a file on your hard drive, I recommend you save the installer program to disk. That way you can redo an installation you messed up. On the other hand, if you don’t have much space on the computer — or you aren’t sure how to find a file once you’ve save it, you are probably better off opening the file straight from the site. I have screwed up so many installations that I pretty much automatically select “Save” when downloading an installer.</p>

          <p>Once you have downloaded the installer, you need to run it. If you told Windows that you wanted to open it from the current location, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you will need to find your file. Open Windows Explorer (‘Start Menu | Programs | Accessories | Windows Explorer’), and dig through your hard drive until you find the installer executable, named <code>Python-2.6.1.msi</code>. Double-click the icon to run the program,  and you’re on your way to installing Python!</p>

          <p>I’m going to skim through the next bit here. Most of the installation is simply “Do you want me to install Python in folder X?” and “Do you want me to call it Python?” Most of the options you can safely run through by clicking “Next”, but stay alert for anything that you might want different from the defaults.</p>

          <p>Eventually, you are presented with a little progress bar while the installer puts all of the Python files where they belong. This is the stage where you sip some coffee (or tea, or soda) and dream about all the great things you will be able to do as a programmer.</p>

          <p>That page has links to articles which discuss Python, tutorials, and comparisons to other languages. Python was largely written for educational environments: learning how to do things “the Python way” makes it easier to write clean, readable programs for any language. Plus, its flexibility makes it useful way past the classroom — unlike the stuff like Applesoft BASIC that <em>I</em> learned in class. There is nothing like spending years trying to forget the stuff that BASIC taught me about programming.</p>

          <p>IDLE is Python’s Integrated DeveLopment Environment. It’s just a coincidence that the acronym <em>happens</em> to spell out the last name of one of the members of a British comedy troupe — whose name just <em>happens</em> to contain the word “Python”.

A <em>variable</em> is basically just something you want the computer to remember so that you can use it later. What’s a <em>function</em>? Don’t worry about that today.

          <p>Every time you normally tell Python to print something, it will print that something out, and then start a new line. If you paste a comma onto the end of the thing you want to print, it’s just like a comma in conversation. It means that you’re pausing for air, and the sentence isn’t done yet. Instead of starting a new line, Python just inserts a space. The next thing that gets printed will show up on the same line.</p>

          <p>In this case, Python prints the phrase “Hello”, followed by a space, and ending with the name that was given to it by <code>raw_input</code>.</p>

          <p>What if we wanted to be able to get that warm fuzzy feeling any time? It’s only two lines of code. We could probably enter that in the shell when we wanted some warm words. But there’s a school of  programming that tells us Laziness is a virtue. Why write the same two lines again and again, when we could write them once, call it a program, and run that program anytime we felt blue?</p>

          <p>Well, they’re Python comments. Comments start from the character <code>#</code>, and extend to the end of the line that you wrote them on. Python  ignores comments, which means that you can use them to explain what is going on in your code. Comments are good. When you come back to look at a complex script after several months, you might forget what some block of code does. Having the comments there to remind you will make it that much easier to sort everything out.</p>

          <p>Just try to match the header complexity to the program. Using this header for a program that consists of two lines of code might be a <em>little</em> bit of overkill. I usually start with something like the two-line header and expand it as I see fit.</p>

          <p>After you enter your script, you need to save it. That’s easy. Just go to the “File” menu and select “Save As…​”. You will be shown a dialog that should look pretty familiar if you’ve ever worked with an editing program. Choose a directory to place your program, enter a name ending with <code>.py</code> — to let your computer know that this is a Python file — and click “Save”. You have now saved your file.</p>

          <p>The Python installation automatically associates the <code>py</code> extension with Python program, which tells Windows that anything ending with <code>.py</code> should be handed over to Python. That means you can just double-click on <code>hello.py</code>, and Python will automatically run it. Unfortunately, that’s not very helpful for most of the stuff we’ll be writing. Try it yourself. You get a DOS box prompting you for your name, but the box disappears almost as soon as you press ENTER! That is kind of annoying.</p>
