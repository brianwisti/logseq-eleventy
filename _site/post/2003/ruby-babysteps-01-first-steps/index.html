          <p><a href="/ruby" class="page-link">Ruby</a> is an exciting language with a huge number of features that appeal to advanced programmers. You should not let that intimidate you, though. The language is very easy to get started with, and you can work your way into the more arcane corners.</p>

          <p>Of course, if you want to use Ruby, you have to install it. To be honest, installation used to be the trickiest part of dealing with Ruby. It’s a lot easier to install it these days, depending on your operating system.</p>

          <p>As with all things Linux, getting Ruby depends on your distribution. See if it is already installed on your system. If not, check to see if it’s available on your distribution discs. If that fails as well, you might as well move on to the world of compiling software yourself. See a little further below for details.</p>

          <p>OS X users have it good. Sort of. A fairly recent Ruby is already available on the Developer Disk for OS X, so you don’t need to mess with any of that other stuff to get started. It’s likely that you will want to later on, but you’ve got enough to get you started. Definitely more than you’ll be needing with this tutorial!</p>

          <p>Well, they’re Ruby <em>comments</em>. Comments start from the character <code>#</code>, and extend to the end of the line that you wrote them on. Ruby ignores comments, which means that you can use them to explain what is going on in your code. Comments are good. When you come back to look at a complex script after several months, you might forget what some block of code does. Having the comments there to remind you will make it that much easier to sort everything out.</p>

          <p>We stored the string “Brian” in the variable <code>name</code>. A <em>variable</em> is basically just something you want the computer to remember so that you can get to it later. You can get a lot more complicated than that if you want, and a lot of programmers do. However, this definition should do for a long time.</p>

          <p>The string itself is a special sort of variable called an <em>object</em>. Objects are very powerful things — so powerful that every variable in Ruby is an object. You can do a lot more with a variable than just ask the computer what the object’s value is. An object has a set of things that it knows how to do. For example: a String knows how to ask Ruby to work out a value when you place some Ruby code - such as a variable name — inside the string. The code is marked by special characters. Then it will take the value that Ruby found, and insert it where the special marker was placed. You could change the value of <code>name</code> and rerun the program. The correct value will be displayed in the greeting string.</p>

          <p>Having a program that displays the exact same message every time you run it is nice when it comes to being consistent, but not so entertaining as a program. Let’s make things a little more interesting still. Instead of changing the value of <code>name</code> in the code of the program, we can use the <code>gets</code> method to get a name from the user.</p>

          <p>The <code>gets</code> method … wait, I used that word again, “method”. You might be wondering what that is supposed to be. A <em>method</em> is one thing that an object is capable of. We have to call it by name. You can’t just say “Ball, do whatever it is you do.” We have to say “Ball, bounce!” In the real world, of course, talking to the ball would not be very helpful. But you get the idea.</p>

          <p><code>gets</code> is a method that gets a line of text from the user and <em>returns</em> it to - or hands back to - the program. What do we do with that reply? We <code>chomp</code> it! <code>gets</code> returns <em>all</em> of the text it gets, including the bit that represents the ENTER key you pressed. We don’t want to keep that, though, so we need a safe way to remove the ENTER character without doing anything to the rest of the string. <code>chomp</code> is a method associated with Strings of text which asks the string to remove that rogue ENTER character. A cleaner copy of the string is returned for you to display.</p>

          <p>If you don’t believe me about the ENTER character, you can test it for yourself. In the string which is printed by <code>puts</code>, replace <code>name</code> with <code>reply</code>. You’ll see what I am talking about.</p>

          <p>Generally, you call an object’s methods by tagging a dot and the method name at the end, like <code>object.method</code>. There are lots of things you can do with methods, and lots of ways to treat them, but that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>

          <p>Congratulations! You have just begun learning Ruby. You just wrote a complete program which gets input from a user, and prints output which includes a modified version of their input! Stop for a minute and think about that. Of course there’s a lot more to learn, but it’s well within your abilities. There is an ever-growing abundance of resources for the “Ruby Newbie”, and you should take advantage of as many of them as possible!</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby home page</a> is pretty much the   best place to start, since that is where you’ll find Ruby itself, as   well as information about user mailing lists that you might be   interested in subscribing to. Never underestimate the potential help   that you can get from the rest of the community.</p>
