          <p>Yeah, I’m a bit of a news junkie, but mainly from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030730132927/http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>. That’s probably due to some untreated Anglophilia that I really should address. Anyhow, I put together a nifty little <a href="/perl" class="page-link">Perl</a> CGI to make it easy for me to scan the latest news feeds from the BBC. Eventually, it’ll be able to load every single <a href="/rss" class="page-link">RSS</a> feed that BBC makes available. Right now, it’s just the World News headline.</p>
