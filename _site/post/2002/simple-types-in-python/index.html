          <p>Python gives us a lot of freedom in creating variable names, also known as <em>identifiers</em>. As long as they start with a letter or underscore (<code>_</code>), and are followed by letters, numbers, or underscores, you’re generally good to go. Case is important, so <code>number</code>, <code>NUMBER</code>, and <code>Number</code> are three different names. The biggest restriction is that you can’t use an identifier that is already used by Python. This means no variables named <code>print</code>, for example.</p>

          <p>Use descriptive names rather than abbreviations or inside jokes. When you are naming a variable that holds the radius of a circle, it is usually better to use <code>radius</code> than <code>r</code> or <code>halfway_there</code>  — Use a name that indicates what the variable will be used for. <code>radius</code> is much better than <code>fnord</code> for describing the radius of a circle. Plus, “fnord” breaks the “no inside jokes” guideline.</p>

          <p>It is common practice to use all upper case letters for identifiers that describe constants — variables which will not be changing their values. Since pi will always have the value 3.1415926 — or so — you would use an identifier of <code>PI</code> for this variable.</p>

          <p>There are two popular approaches to devising longer names (the ones that consist of two or more words pasted together). In the first, the two words are separated by underscores where the spaces would be. In this tradition, “customer name” would be written as <code>customer_name</code>. The other school uses capitalization to show separation, and would write the same “customer name” as <code>CustomerName</code>, or maybe <code>customerName</code>.</p>

          <p>I use underscores in my own code. I don’t really care which one you use, but stay consistent. Try not to follow <code>customer_name</code> with <code>CustomerAddress</code>. And whatever you do, <em>please</em> don’t mix the two in the same variable. Identifiers like <code>Customer_Name</code> will only serve to aggravate me and hasten the approach of carpal tunnel syndrome for you. I am so emphatic about this silly little issue because I am saying this as somebody who has to read code written by other people.</p>

          <p>Let’s throw in another fancy technical term, since it’ll help us understand types in the next section. <em>Literal</em> is a fancy name for a plain old value. In the statement <code>number = 5</code>, <code>5</code> is the literal. Most often, you’ll see literals being used in assigning a value to your variables. There are different ways to write literals, depending on what type of variable you are assigning to.</p>

          <p>Right away, you realized that Bob is a raving lunatic — or maybe a Zen master — because <code>&quot;Brian&quot; + 5</code> just doesn’t work. You’re not supposed to combine words and numbers like that. It isn’t polite.</p>

          <p><em>Types</em> are used by programming languages to recognize when programmers are starting to sound like a raving lunatic. Every type has rules for what you can do with them. You can do numbery things to numbers (add, subtract, find the square root of, etcetera). You can do stringy things to strings of text (search, capitalize, concatenate, and so on). Capitalizing numbers is a no-no, as is finding the square root of your name. When you learn how to create your own types later on, you will also be writing the rules for how your new types can be used.</p>

          <p>An <em>exception</em> is a special type in Python that we’ll be seeing a lot of as we learn. Think back to that conversation with Bob. As soon as he asked you to add <code>5</code> to your name, a little red flag went up in your brain. This red flag told you that something was very wrong with dear old Bob. <em>Exceptions</em> are the little red flags that Python uses to tell you that something is very wrong. There are a lot of ways that things can go wrong, so there are a lot of different types of exception that we will see. Let’s see what Python does when we play the role of Bob.</p>

          <p>Nothing illustrates the idea of types as clearly as the number. Most of us know what a number is, and can understand the sorts of things we do with numbers: add them, subtract them, ignore them when they’re written on a bill, and so on. We know how to compare numbers to determine which is greater. Things get a little murky when we start talking about the String type or the HttpServer type, but we know what numbers are. Lucky for us, so does Python.</p>

          <p>Amazingly enough, Python takes care of telling one from the other, and we don’t need to worry about it most of the time. Just feed it a literal, and it’ll try to do the right thing.

          <p>What? Where did that <code>L</code> come from? It turns out that computers are faster at dealing with integers if they can fit them into a small chunk of memory. That “small chunk” is still more than enough room for most of the numbers that you’ll deal with in your day-to-day programming. Until you start converting parsecs to inches, <code>2,147,483,647</code> should be more than enough room.</p>

          <p>When you hand it a really large literal like <code>355556499871154247854</code>, Python notices right away that it won’t fit as a regular integer, and automatically makes it a long integer. There are times when you know in advance that your number will end up being very large. Specifying long integer type is very very easy. Just paste the letter <code>L</code> to the end of your literal.</p>

          <p>While it is technically okay to use a lowercase <code>l</code>, it is <em>much</em> harder to read when scanning program code. <code>6209389143l</code> looks too much like <code>62093891431</code>. It’s a good idea to always use the upper case <code>L</code> for specifying long integers.</p>

          <p>It’s like this, see. Computers are basically made up of switches. On and off. <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>. That’s all a computer knows. It takes many layers of programming to translate your value into something that a computer can understand, and then more layers to turn it back into something you can understand. With integers, it’s relatively easy. It’s a simple matter for the computer to handle whole numbers. Floating point, however, is much more fluid. It takes a lot of work for the computer to translate a floating point value into a series of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> switches. To save time and memory, it fudges the number a little bit. For most programs, it’s not a problem. It certainly hasn’t been an issue for me in <em>any</em> program I’ve written. There are also some excellent programming libraries out there when you do hit that particular wall. Everyday python does an excellent job of protecting us from all the chaos when printing a variable:</p>
