          <p>That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.zenspider.com/seattle.rb">Seattle.rb</a> meeting got me to thinking. Unit testing is a big part of software development, but I know very little about it. It seems to me that my cute little PageTemplate project presents a perfect opportunity to learn. It’s a small project, so I can keep most of it in my head. It’s not so small that unit testing would be overkill - “killing a fly with a bazooka”. I was bothered by some of the robustness of the code anyways.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>Why has the code been on my mind? I’ve been reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://tpop.awl.com/">The Practice of Programming</a>, by Kernighan and Pike. This book is a broad strokes overview of how to be a good developer. It covers design, algorithms, testing, and quite a bit more, in a thin volume. Good stuff. If you already have a good idea how to write code, but want to be an actual programmer, I highly recommend this book.</p>

          <p>Enough with the sales pitch. The book helped me understand several data structures: what they are, how to use them, and most importantly, when you could use them. I’ve had several “a-ha” moments reading TPOP, and one of them involved a complete rewrite of the PageTemplate engine using much cleaner data structures.</p>

          <p>That’s my new plan. Write some test cases, write the code, release when everything is okay, and then do whatever my heart desires.</p>
