          <p>It’s been an organizing week more than anything else for me. I decided to apply the magic of <code>make</code> to the site building process, which automates creation and installation of site files. Either that, or I’m about to wipe out the entire site. Let’s hope not!</p>

          <p>I spent a few hours arranging and adding captions to some of the galleries in the photo album. Not every gallery has comments, because I ran out of ideas after a while. There are a few, though.</p>

          <p>Once again there are no new drawings. I’ve been busy with a lot of different things, but I’m running out of excuses now. I best get some new drawings done. Meanwhile, you can peek through history to see a few older drawings that I’ve scanned and put into the drawings section. It’s nothing great, but it felt like too much time had passed since the last time I put pictures online.</p>
