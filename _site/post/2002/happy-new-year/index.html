          <p>Hey there, Happy New Year! 2002 seems to be off to a friendly start for me. There isn’t any new content today, because I’ve been busy with other things. “Like what?” you ask, or maybe not. For starters, I toyed with the idea of redoing this site with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>. I’m still toying, but that means giving up a lot of hard-won tricks with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://webmake.taint.org/">WebMake</a>. We’ll see where that goes.</p>

          <p>I used to have a warning on the front page. I still do, but now it only shows up if your browser doesn’t:</p>

          <p>It’s a cheap and dirty trick, but it should work quite nicely. Now people who don’t have to worry about it won’t have to see a warning about somebody else’s browser.</p>

          <p>I finally got around to creating a page for older site news. I just took everything from last year and put it on a different page. I might do something fancier as time wears on.</p>

          <p>In news that is much more exciting for me personally, I got an email yesterday from Eric A. Meyer, author of two major CSS books and producer of the inspirational <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/">css/edge</a> site. You don’t have to look too hard to notice the similarities between COOLNAMEHERE and his pages. I was never expecting to get an email from anybody who wrote books that are sitting on my shelf - especially an unsolicited one. Second off, I was surprised by how nice he was. Not that the existence of nice people is a surprise, just … oh, I don’t know. You never expect people to be nice to <em>you</em>.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>Apparently, he was looking through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050206183943/http://www.google.com/">Google</a> to find people who were using his css/edge concepts, and this site was one of the entries that came up. Actually, you should try it yourself. Just go to Google and look for “css/edge” - you will find some pretty awesome work by other folks who found Eric Meyer’s stuff irresistably attractive.</p>

          <p>He even directly addressed my own little jab at myself for “ripping off” his site. Here’s the cool bit:</p>

        
      

      
  
    
      
        
  
    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <blockquote>
<p>Far from a ripoff, I think your site shows a nice dash of creativity in taking various css/edge ideas and using them in your own way. In fact, I feel rather flattered to see you using my concepts for your site. Anyway, I made the design concepts and markup freely available, so no harm done regardless. Share and enjoy, that’s my philosophy…</p>

          <p>Is that not cool? I hurried up to get his permission to mention it on this site. As mentioned elsewhere on the site, I have a fragile ego that responds quickly to kind words.</p>

          <p>That’s about it. A little site housekeeping, and me jumping up and down in excitement, but no new content. I think I’ll go play with CSS now.</p>
