          <p>Okay. postNuke is long gone. It’s a fine tool, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do with my free time. Yeah, I have to think about free time again, because I’ve just started working at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://omnigroup.com/">Omni Group</a> as a tech support person. The job is great, and the people are great. Plus, it’s a Mac shop, so I’m surrounded by machines running OS X. It may not be Linux, but it’s a much better environment for me than Windows. Life being the odd thing that it is, I am working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.zenspider.com/">ZenSpider</a>, a classmate from high school who also happens to be a freakishly skilled programmer. He’s very active with  <a href="/ruby" class="page-link">Ruby</a> , and has also been teaching me <em>(indirectly and possibly without his full awareness)</em> about the wonders of unit testing and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> - stupid name, but a lot of good ideas.</p>

          <p>So I’ve been working hard on grasping the finer points of Ruby, especially the Ruby/Tk GUI toolkit. There’s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://httpd.chello.nl/k.vangelder/ruby/learntk/">excellent tutorial</a> on the subject, but not much else. I have found myself digging around in the tk.rb code, and looking for quick and dirty guides to Tcl/Tk. If you have any suggestions, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810055550/http://www.coolnamehere.com/brian/index.html">let me know</a>.</p>

          <p>Oh yeah, and the  Ruby Geekery  section is back up. Not much there, but … you know, someday.</p>
