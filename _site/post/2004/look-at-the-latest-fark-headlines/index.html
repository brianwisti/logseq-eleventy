          <p>I want to look at the Fark headlines without opening a browser. Why? Well, as it so happens, I am logged into a machine via <code>ssh</code>, and using <code>elinks</code> to load the page will result in a lot of extra clutter from text versions of ads which obscure the headlines. I’m just interested in seeing what interesting, scary, or amusing things have been posted on Fark since the last time I checked.</p>

          <p>Now I get the RSS file dumped to the console. At least the story headlines are little easier to find. To get the behavior I want, though, we’re going to need to chop out the bits we don’t care about and get straight to the headlines. This task is straightforward in Ruby, thanks to the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rss/rdoc/index.html">RSS</a> library. The RSS library has recently been made an official part of the standard libs, which makes a lot of this exercise much easier.</p>

          <p>Wherever possible, I’m using standard library tools to get my work done. I’m too lazy to remember escaping every possible HTML entity, and I would rather spend a few minutes searching through the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/">Standard Library documentation</a> to find what I need. It’s a good habit, and you might want to try it yourself.</p>

          <p>This program now does everything that I set out to do, and then some. I might choose to do a some refactoring to “bulletproof” the code, or wrap it up in some OO niceness to make it pretty. The truth is that this application is exactly what it needs to be for now, and I think that I shouldn’t overwork something that I may never come back to. Maybe later I’ll come back to it when I think of new features or find new bugs, and <em>then</em> I can overwork it to my heart’s content.</p>
