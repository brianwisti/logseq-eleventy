          <p><a href="/rebol" class="page-link">REBOL</a> is the “Relative Expression-Based Object Language”, developed by Carl Sassenrath. Who is Carl Sassenrath? Why, he’s one of the people responsible for the amazing operating system which powered the Amiga computer. What’s the Amiga? Why, the Amiga was only the incredibly robust and cool computer — released by the same company that brought the world’s first personal computer, Commodore. What’s Commodore? Stop bothering me, kid. Take it from a relative old-timer: Amiga put a <em>heck</em> of a lot of power into a consumer-affordable personal computer. It wasn’t really matched by other computers for a good five or ten years. Nowadays, I look at <a href="http://www.rebol.com/">REBOL</a> and it feels like the first language I’ve come across to take lessons from past languages and apply them in a new context, rather than just reimplement them with different syntax.</p>

          <p>So why would you want to learn REBOL? Because REBOL makes it frighteningly easy to create programs that accomplish complex tasks. For example, here’s one way you can download the HTML source of a Web page – for example <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/">https://randomgeekery.org/</a> – and view it in a text editing area with REBOL/View:</p>

          <p>These pages are intended to provide the non-programmer with a gentle introduction to the REBOL language and environment. When you are done with it, you should feel ready to learn more, and curious to dig into the possibilities. You won’t be an expert, but maybe you’ll feel bold enough to become one and share what you’ve found with the rest of the world. Beginners and experts alike should feel free to send suggestions about how I can improve this tutorial.</p>

          <p>REBOL/Core covers the vital language features, including all the <a href="/post/2004/rebol-datatypes" class="page-link">post/2004/REBOL Datatypes</a> which make the language so attractive to somebody like me. With Core, you can create system shell scripts, CGI applications, or simple command-line applications. Core also provides an interactive shell for testing out code on the fly, which is a valuable asset for getting the hang of a language, or even just trying out an obscure bit of code on a bored Thursday evening.</p>

          <p>View is the cool one, in my opinion. It adds an impressive GUI library to Core, making it immediately useful for a broad range of applications. The utility of View can be compared to Java, but here’s something to really think about regarding the contrast between View and Java. How big of a download is the JDK these days? 10 Megabytes, 40 Megabytes? The REBOL/View installer for Windows is 600 Kilobytes. You can fit it on a <em>floppy disk</em>.</p>

          <p>So double-click its icon or run it from the command-line. Either way, now the REBOL shell is running for you. If you’ve installed View, then you’ve got this pretty Desktop thing. We’ll have to come back to it some other time. For now, just click the icon on the left for “Console”. <em>Now</em> you’ve got the console. It is not as pretty, but it will work for our purposes.</p>

          <p>See? Not that hard at all. Of course, this is pretty standard stuff from most programming languages these days. Well, except Java. But we all just sort of snicker whenever a Java coder enters the room. We would snicker more, but that Java coder is <em>probably</em> making twice what we are. He deserves it, too, for all the carpal tunnel he’s going to get when he tries to write a “Hello World” program.</p>

          <p>Making the computer tell us things is kind of fun, but it would be nice to customize it a little bit. Let’s have the computer ask our name. We can use the <code>ask</code> function (or <em>word</em>) to ask a question and get a response, which we will save in a variable.</p>

          <p>You recognize the code from before, but I imagine you’re curious about the block prefaced by the word <code>REBOL</code>. That is the <em>script header</em>, where you put important information about the script that you are writing.

          <p>Cool, eh? Now you can share this script with all of your Rebol friends just by sending them the file. Of course, you might want to send them something more impressive, but think of it this way - this just gives you the motivation to learn how to do <em>more</em>!</p>

          <p>There you have it. You’ve learned how to write a simple script. Heck, I’ve even snuck in a couple of Rebol’s many datatypes while you weren’t looking. You’re well on the way to becoming a real Rebol programmer!</p>

          <p>There is a lot of documentation available for REBOL, especially considering that the REBOL community is fairly small. RT keeps the official manuals available for free, and there are loads of script libraries and how-to guides written by the users themselves.</p>

          <p><em>P.S.:</em> What, you want me to tell you how to quit REBOL? Why would you ever want to do that? Oh, okay. The command to quit from the REBOL Console is easy to remember: <code>quit</code>. Happy now?</p>
