          <p>Okay, so here’s what happened. A few weeks ago, I released an updated version of  <a href="/pagetemplate" class="page-link">PageTemplate</a> . Then I worked on an updated version of the site with updated documentation, because what I had was a little out-of-date <em>(just the reference page, everything else is still cool)</em>. Then I was distracted by something. I’m not sure what it was that distracted me - might have been work, might have been a heavy code project, or it might have just been a bright and shiny thing that rolled into my view. Whatever the cause, I completely forgot about the site update until I got an email from somebody today pointing out that all the old PageTemplate pages were full of broken links.</p>

          <p>The realy update is at home on my laptop, but I can work on some link fixes to hold me over until I get home this evening and put the <em>real</em> update online.</p>
