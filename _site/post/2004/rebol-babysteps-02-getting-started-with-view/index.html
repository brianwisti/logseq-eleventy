          <p>I’m sure you thought that getting started was fun, but it really didn’t do anything to show off <a href="/rebol" class="page-link">REBOL</a> . I’d like to go through almost exactly the same process, but this time focusing my attention on <a href="http://www.rebol.com/prod-view.html">REBOL/View</a>. So let’s give it a try!</p>

          <p>I’m going to skim through this very quickly. The goal is just for you to see how much potential there is in the REBOL/View dialect. You want to see “Hello World”? Here it is.</p>

          <p>One way to interpret that series of commands is along the lines of: we want to <code>view</code> the <code>layout</code> defined as containing the <code>text</code> “Hello World”. I’ll be the first to admit that this is not an impressive demonstration of GUI programming — unless you’ve actually done some, then you might notice how quick it was to put together compared to using a lot of other toolkits and platforms.</p>

          <p>Still, the whole point of using a GUI is having something to <em>click</em>. Let’s revisit our script from last time and putting some pointy-clicky goodness into it.</p>

          <p>Neat. Except that it doesn’t actually do anything if you click the button. Pretty, but non-functional - sort of like my neighbor’s car. Let’s give the <code>button</code> a block of commands along with the string “Hi!”.</p>

          <p>Sorry, I haven’t gotten a screenshot of the alert just yet. Trust me, though. It’s pretty standard fare for alert boxes. It still doesn’t have that personal touch that the script from <a href="/post/2004/rebol-babysteps-01-getting-started" class="page-link">post/2004/REBOL Babysteps - 01 Getting Started</a> , though. Let’s add a few touches: a little word assignment here, a little phrase-building there with <code>rejoin</code> and some refinements. There, how about this?</p>

          <p>Hey, that was neat. We’ve got a pointy-clicky version of the “Hello” script we made last time. We assigned the field to a word and then used what REBOL calls “refinements” to access the text entered into that field. You will see a lot about refinements as your knowledge of REBOL progresses.</p>

          <p>You still have the same execution options as before, but REBOL/View under Windows gives you an additional choice. You can find your View script via Explorer and double-click. Easy as that!</p>

          <p>This overview didn’t even scratch the surface of REBOL/View. It didn’t even <em>touch</em> the surface, but instead just gave the surface a sideways glance while hurrying to an urgent appointment. I encourage you to take a closer look at REBOL/View and its official documentation.</p>
