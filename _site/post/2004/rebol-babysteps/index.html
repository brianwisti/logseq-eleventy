          <p>Right. Here is this language that you’ve never heard of: <a href="/rebol" class="page-link">REBOL</a>. I think we should learn how to use it together, sort of a “Babysteps” approach. You and I can add REBOL to our steadily expanding toolkit of programming languages.</p>

          <p>And remember to just ignore people when they ask you “Why should I learn REBOL (or Perl, or Python, or Ruby) instead of Perl (or Python, or Ruby, or Java)?” You and I are the sort of people who learn a language <em>in addition</em> to the ones we already know, not <em>instead of</em> the one we were taught in college.</p>

          <p>Okay, maybe that is a little rude. But it works like this: my music teacher taught me that each time you learn a new instrument, it gets a little easier to learn new ones, because you are developing a greater understanding of how to make music. You will also know how to choose the best instrument for a particular piece, because you understand the differences between each available choice. I didn’t learn much musically. I only managed two things:</p>

          <p>So yeah. That’s why you want to learn REBOL. So you can make a sound like an angry weasel. No, make that a <em>happy</em> weasel.</p>

          <p>I add a new page to this tutorial every once in a while, but I don’t believe it’s the best REBOL tutorial available. That honor goes to Nick Antonaccio’s <a href="http://musiclessonz.com/rebol_tutorial.html">Rebol Programming For The Absolute Beginner</a>. I think you should go over there and check it out now. Go ahead, I don’t mind.</p>
