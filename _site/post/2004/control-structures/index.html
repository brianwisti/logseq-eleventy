          <p>There are several different approaches to programming, but the one that is easiest for me to grasp is <em>imperative programming</em>. The imperative approach allows you to tell the computer exactly what you want it to do and how you want it done. The best analogy I can think of is a cooking recipe. You have a list of ingredients and a specific set of instructions to follow. Veer from the recipe and you may not be happy with the results. Veer too far from the recipe and your house could burn down.</p>

          <p>Control structures are the basic building blocks of imperative programming. They describe what kind of instructions the programming language understands. I will explore control structures, using examples from both the cooking world - hey, this is a good analogy and I want to keep using it - and <a href="/python" class="page-link">Python</a>, since Python’s syntax is clean enough that you can see the control structures easily.</p>

          <p>I think that approach is unattractive, though. I’ll do it if I have to, but I will use a prettier and easier tactic if it’s available. A better way is to build a new list based on a modified version of the old list. Python makes this easy with a language feature called <em>list comprehensions</em>, which are funny-looking but very easy once you get the hang of them.</p>

          <p>The last major control structure I am going to look at is <em>remote code</em>. This isn’t technically code on another machine, but I suppose it could be. Remote code was written outside of the main sequence of the application, but you can use it (repeatedly) from within the main sequence. I guess the easiest cooking equivalent would be to hire a person who makes the cookies for you.</p>

          <p>Remote code usually takes the form of functions, classes (the source of the <code>capitalize</code> method used in <em>Repetition</em>), and modules (which are usually collections of classes or functions in a separate file).</p>
