          <p>Why am I getting this newsletter? <a href="https://amplenote.com">Amplenote</a> is a good note / task system. Free tier is useful. First paid tier is inexpensive. I like the mobile app. Works great for quickly capturing thoughts, which I pull into my primary as needed. Turns out the newsletter is also good, both for Amplenote tips and general ideas.</p>

          <p>Each project gets its own note. Link back to that in supplemental notes rather than cluttering up your tags with <code>#my-project</code>. Big projects could have a main note that holds the task list and links out to supplemental notes, <a href="https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6">MOC</a>-style.</p>

          <p>Use tags for broader classifications. Maybe that main project note gets tagged <code>#project</code>. When it’s done, it gets an <code>#archived</code> tag.</p>

          <p>I already give each project its own note, but I tend to give them overly specific tags. Something I’m already thinking about, and that newsletter made me think more. Will probably refactor my tags.</p>

          <p>Logging? Right now I log my project activity in the daily journal. But for big projects that makes my project note’s backlinks a bit of a mess. To cut down on the amount of clicking and scanning, I pull tidbits that seem interesting back into the project note. Sort of like a topic note, improving and refining as I get more information.</p>

          <p>Something I’m starting to realize: a project note is not a topic note. Once I finish a project, it’s part of the historical record rather than a still-evolving resource.</p>

          <p>On first read, logging activity to the project sounds better. I can see all the activity for a project by scrolling. It would get cluttered, but I lean hard on collapsible outline views — <a href="/logseq" class="page-link">Logseq</a> is my primary note system today.</p>

          <p>But for note systems that don’t offer infinitely nested lists maybe not? Even for the ones that do, it could clarify backlinks. My dev projects could have <code>#project/planning</code> and <code>#project/dev</code> notes to show the nature of the day’s work. Those notes could also act as clarifying intermediate links between the project I worked on and the day I did the work.</p>
