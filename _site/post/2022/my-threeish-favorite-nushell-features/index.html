          <p>Today I use Nushell for one of my favorite learning tasks: examining my site. I made a throwaway one-liner for <a href="/post/2022/trying-nushell-on-windows" class="page-link">post/2022/Trying Nushell on Windows</a>. I want to try again, and think through the process a little more this time.</p>

          <p>This post, and any that may follow on the topic, won’t be any kind of deep dive or contrast with other shells. Oh sure. I’ll point out things that surprise me. But I use maybe 20% of a shell’s features for 80% of my needs, and a Web search for the rest. Check the Nushell book’s <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/book/coming_from_bash.html">Coming from Bash</a> page if you want a more explicit comparison.</p>

          <p>See, my one-liner’s getting a little long. Over in other shells, I’d be pulling out a backslash ‘\’ to indicate line continuation. But Nushell is expression-oriented. Ending a line with a backslash is just an error. So we turn the whole thing into a subexpression by wrapping it in parentheses. Nushell treats the evaluated result as a single expression, however many lines it takes to get there.</p>

          <p>It also supports more complex structured types like records and of course tables. Nushell may not define as many types as <a href="https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/datatypes.adoc">Red</a> — yet? — but it has far more than I’m accustomed to seeing from a shell.</p>

          <p>True confession time: my three or so favorite features in Nushell are also the only features I’ve played with, and much of that was today.
Just realized it’s been about a year since I started poking at Nushell as more than “that thing with cool <code>ls</code> output.”</p>

          <p>It’s not my login <code>$SHELL</code> or anything yet — still need to figure out things like <code>pyenv</code> and <code>nvm</code> — but yeah I like using Nushell.
Especially under Windows, where I know little enough about PowerShell that I can set up Nushell on Windows Terminal and pretend it’s a login shell.</p>
