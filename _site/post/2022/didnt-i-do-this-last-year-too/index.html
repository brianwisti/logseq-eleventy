          <p>So anyways yeah. Site’s built with <a href="/hugo" class="page-link">Hugo</a> again. This iteration is relatively minimal: let Hugo be Hugo with Markdown, render hooks, and shortcodes. A <code>justfile</code>. Some Python for preprocessing and tests. Right, and <code>markdownlint-cli</code>. I’d love to do posts about some or all of the pieces.</p>

          <p>Notes and bookmarks got merged into the main post stream. Internal links are clean, but no promises yet about links from the outside world. That’s a pretty big shuffle I just did.</p>

          <p>Yeah. One of our kitties — Jack — has been having trouble keeping his food down for a few days. We had better luck with soft food today, but he still threw up a little. Let him sleep it off wherever he likes, and check periodically to make sure he’s breathing. He’s eating less than usual, but at least he’s still eating.</p>

          <p>Got a vet appointment for Friday, and a 24-hour emergency vet that said to bring him down if he gets traumatically worse.</p>
