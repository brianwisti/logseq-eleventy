          <p>We have inched our way forward in our understanding of <a href="/parrot" class="page-link">Parrot</a> and PIR. I think that it’s time to take a big step, though. We’re going to add file handling to our toolkit. Reading and writing files are easy tasks in Parrot - so easy that I could probably discuss both in a couple of paragraphs and be more or less done. But I’m hungry for something meatier. I want to work with a lot of data and get curious trivia from that data. Hashes are good, too. Let’s look at Parrot hashes at some point today as well.</p>

          <p>It took me some time to decide exactly what sort of data I wanted to look at. I was thinking of <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964">nutritional data</a>, but I’m not ready  for all of the cross-referencing I’d have to do in order to produce information that would be meaningful to me.</p>

          <p>Then it hit me. I love astronomy. Wait a moment. That’s not completely true. I like astronomy. It teaches us a lot about our place in the universe, and exactly how freaking small we really are. What I love is random trivia about space: the name of the closest star to our solar system, how many of our neighboring stars are sort of like ours, stuff like that. I want to write a program that will help me get those juicy tidbits.</p>

          <p>The next challenge was finding a data source that would be useful for me. There are plenty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_catalogues">star catalogs</a> available. The problem is that I like astronomy - I don’t love it. Much of modern astronomy is incomprehensible to me unless it has a pretty picture of a penny next to a football field illustrating interplanetary distances or some other thing I can pretend to understand. Oh, and remember that I barely know Parrot. I need something simple and easy to parse, but big enough to have interesting data.</p>

          <p>After nearly 15 minutes of dedicated research - once you subtract the hours spent admiring the <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html">Astronomy Picture of the Day archives</a> - I came across David Nash’s <a href="http://astronexus.com">Astronomy Nexus</a>. This is a great resource for amateur astronomers, space trivia buffs, and people who enjoy geeky pictures like the view of Earth from <a href="http://astronexus.com/node/157">Gliese 581</a>. It also has a nice, easily parsed file listing almost 120,000 stars. At roughly 20 Megabytes uncompressed, that’s big enough to be interesting.</p>

          <p>Is it <em>necessary</em> to close the file, though? That’s a reasonable question. Many modern languages close files automatically when their handle goes out of scope — for example, when the program ends. The Parrot Book <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/latest/html/docs/book/pir/ch08_io.pod.html">I/O chapter</a> does not make it clear what Parrot’s approach is, though. I’m going to keep closing those finished files until somebody tells me otherwise.
I’ll probably continue closing finished files even after somebody tells me otherwise, truthfully.  I am one of those people who likes explicit code and ties his shoelaces with a tidy little double-knot. I can’t help it - it’s in my nature.</p>

          <p>That’s all the important information about reading files. Oh sure, there are details we’ll need to look at eventually, such as what happens when the file doesn’t exist or you don’t have permission. But for reading a file that we know exists and that we can read, <code>open</code>, <code>readline</code>, and <code>close</code> are the main bits.</p>

          <p>Perl has the builtin <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp.html"><code>chomp</code></a> function which is perfect for exactly this situation. Parrot doesn’t have <code>chomp</code> as a builtin, but it is available via the standard <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/RELEASE_3_0_0/runtime/parrot/library/String/Utils.pir">String/Utils</a> library. There’s no need to download anything extra, because “String/Utils” ships with Parrot.</p>

          <p><code>get_global</code> is a <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/latest/html/src/ops/var.ops.html">variable opcode</a> that allows us to get a PMC from the global namespace. Used like this, it allows us to grab a PMC from a specific available namespace. What makes namespaces great is the fact that they can have any number of variable names without cluttering the globally available list of names. On the other hand, you need to take an extra step to make that name available for your own use. That is fairly consistent with other languages that I’ve used, although maybe a little lower level than I care for. Oh well. This is a low-level language, after all.</p>

          <p>One way to do that is with a <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/latest/html/src/pmc/hash.pmc.html">Hash</a>. This is a collection structure similar to an array.

          <p>You may have noticed that I reassign some variables with the same value they probably already had. This may not be efficient, but it’s for my own sanity. I want to be certain about the values held in those variables. I am also pretending these little labelled regions are like distinct blocks of code. It’s a lie, but a useful one.</p>

          <p>Those are disappointing results. It looks like we have many neighbors that look like our Sun, but only one with a name. I would love to use one of the alternate references if available, such as the <a href="http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/datenbanken/aricns/gliese.htm">Gliese</a> or <a href="http://www.skyviewcafe.com/bayer_flamsteed.html">Bayer-Flamsteed</a> designations. I don’t think that’s practical with how we’re writing our Parrot application today.</p>

          <p>Wow. There has been a lot of new stuff today. Not only did we learn how to read files and use Hashes, we also saw how to load bytecode libraries. We counted, searched through, and displayed data from a 20 Megabyte text file with nearly 120,000 entries. We also learned that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri">Rigel Kentaurus A</a> is the only named neighbor in the database that is the same spectral type as our Sun.</p>

          <p>I think we’re reaching the limits of what I want to do with <code>goto</code> as my primary  tool for guiding program flow. PIR Code is getting harder to write and edit. The next step really should be creating subroutines to abstract some of the more complicated or tedious processes.</p>
