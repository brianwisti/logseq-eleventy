          <p>We started looking at arrays in <a href="/post/2009/parrot-babysteps-04-adding-command-line-arguments" class="page-link">post/2009/Parrot Babysteps 04 - Adding Command Line Arguments</a> . We’re going to take a closer look today, exploring different ways of looking at <a href="/parrot" class="page-link">Parrot</a> arrays to build an averaging calculator. We’ll start with no array at all, to build the basic flow of our program and to demonstrate that an array is not always needed. Then we’ll move on to more interesting stuff, with array indexing, stack opcodes, and iterators.</p>

          <p>Our averaging program is going to get its input from the user, and will take an arbitrary quantity of Numbers. Basically, it will keep accepting Numbers until the user indicates that she’s done. It will then display the average of all Numbers and exit.</p>

          <p>Sounds simple enough. How will the user tell the program that she’s done? I like the idea of using the string “done”. It’s easy to remember and to the point. Wait. Let me think about that for a moment. The phrase “done” may be easy to remember, but “quit” is more common for leaving an interactive shell. I guess we should use “quit”.</p>

          <p>Why did I show this? Well, basically because “write an averaging program without using an Array in the language of your choice” is an interview question I’ve been asked a couple of times. It’s been a while, but I thought I’d be ready in case somebody asked me again. They’ll probably expect me to use Java or Ruby or something. This will show them. This will show them all! This will show them - uhh - I’m not sure what it’ll show them.
Anyways - I wrote this version because I felt like it. Let’s start writing code that uses arrays, okay?</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)">stack</a> is one of the fundamental data structures. The mental image is straightforward: you have a stack of things. You can <em>push</em> a new thing onto the stack, or you can <em>pop</em> the top thing from the stack into your hand. Stacks provide a simple way to handle every item in a collection. One thing you need to keep in mind is consistent with that stack image: once you’ve popped an item from the stack, it’s not in the collection anymore. So popping all the way through a stack results in what? Yes, that’s right. It results in an empty stack.</p>

          <p>While <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> work on the end of an array, Parrot also provides <code>unshift</code> and <code>shift</code> which handle corresponding functionality on the front of an array. Let’s go back to the stack image for a moment. We already have the basic idea of pushing onto and popping off of the top of a stack. We can also <em>shift</em> an item from the bottom of that stack. What used to be the first item is now in our hands, and the rested of the stack has <em>shifted</em> down so that the old second item is the new first item. We can <em>unshift</em> an item into the bottom of the stack. Now that unshifted item is the new first in the collection, and the old first item is now the second.</p>

          <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(data_structure)">queue</a> is yet another way of looking at our array when you are concerned about order. Stacks are LIFO: when you pop an item from the stack, you’re getting the last item that was pushed. Queues are FIFO: when you shift an item from the queue, you get the first item that was pushed. Okay - the technical term for placing an item in the queue is <em>enqueue</em> and for grabbing an item is <em>dequeue</em>. Pushing and shifting refer to the opcodes we’re using. Use whatever term you’re happier with.</p>

          <p>The actual code for using a queue instead of a stack still doesn’t look all that different, because they’re still producing the same final result. Let’s write an example that clearly demonstrates the difference between a queue and a stack:</p>

          <p>Stacks and queues are a practical solution to a wide range of collection-handling problems. They do have one shortcoming, though. Both of them are destructive. When you <code>pop</code> or <code>shift</code> a value from an array, you are actually removing that value.</p>

          <p>There is nothing left after you have popped or shifted the last value. Sometimes that is okay, but sometimes you want to use the array for some other calculation. Those are the situations where you want a way to access the contents of the array without changing them. One way to do that is by accessing contents via an index.</p>

          <p>The Parrot <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/docs/pmc/array.pod.html">Array documentation</a> shows a few things about setting up fixed-size arrays and setting individual values within arrays, but what I care about is the fact that array elements are accessed pretty much the same as in other languages I’m familiar with. We use square brackets <code>[]</code> to access a specific element, and the count is zero-based. Yes, zero-based indexing can be a little confusing sometimes. Think of it as “how many items from the front is the element I want?” and you should be fine.</p>

          <p>All right. This example is easier for me to read than the others for some reason. That could be due to the simple fact that I’ve been looking at Parrot arrays for a couple of hours now. Maybe it’s because my blocks are more clearly labelled. Maybe it’s because using an iterator allowed me to build up a sum and still get the length the length of <code>numbers</code> later, rather than building up two values at the same time. I’m not really sure. I do know that I feel like the iterator has given me a nice little convenience layer for handling my array. The output is still the same.</p>

          <p>We had already taken a glance at arrays when we worked with the command line. Today we dove a little deeper, looking into different ways we can access the contents of an array. Now you understand how to treat a ‘ResizableFloatArray’ like a stack, a queue, a plain old array, or an iterable collection. These principles should work for other array types as well. Parrot has many array PMCs, and you can find them on <a href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/pmc.html">the list of core PMCs</a>.</p>
