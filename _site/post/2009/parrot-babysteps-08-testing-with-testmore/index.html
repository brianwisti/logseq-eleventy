          <p>I’ll be creating more complex PIR programs soon, but first I want to stop for a minute and look at testing in Parrot. Why? Code is a weird thing. You need to pin down its behavior as specifically as you can, or it’ll become unreadable before you realize what’s going on. Good tests help you describe how your program should behave. Tests aren’t a magic pill that will guarantee perfect programs, but they <em>will</em> help you check that your program behaves the way you claim it does.</p>

          <p>There are many testing libraries in the programming world, but I will focus
on <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/RELEASE_3_0_0/runtime/parrot/library/Test/More.pir">Test::More</a> for Parrot.</p>

          <p>Test::More is more or less an implementation of <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html">Perl’s Test::More</a>. It provides a set of simple assertions such as <code>ok</code>, <code>is</code>, and <code>isnt</code>, along with a few testing-specific commands like <code>skip</code> and <code>todo</code>. I’ll be looking at some of those simple assertions, but not spending so much time on the testing commands. This <em>is</em> a Babystep, after all.
Test::More is already included in the standard Parrot runtime, so we don’t need to do anything special to install it. Even better - there’s a <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/RELEASE_3_0_0/runtime/parrot/library/Test/More.pir">test_more.pir</a> include file that you can include to import all of the important Test::More subroutines automatically.</p>

          <p>Every test needs a plan. The <code>plan</code> subroutine in Test::More tells the world one simple thing: how many tests are in this file. Accuracy is important, because it’s no fun when you are told to expect ten tests but only five run. The other five might not have run for a number of reasons: the test script failed, Parrot failed in some mysterious way, or you just forgot to mention that you removed half of your tests.</p>

          <p>All of this output has looked remarkably consistent. There’s a reason for that. Test::More formats its result in a format known as TAP - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">Test Anything Protocol</a>. All of the output can be read by another program to provide you with a summary report. This other program is usually referred to as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_harness">test harness</a>. The test harness runs your tests and then tells you how many of them failed, or if there were any surprises.</p>

          <p>Hey, we can test now! We learned how to use the Test::More library, making simple assertions and reporting the results using the Test Anything Protocol. As long as we stay disciplined and run our tests regularly, we will learn immediately when we have an “inspired” moment that breaks existing code. Since I’m such a huge fan of Test-Driven Development, you can be assured of seeing many assertions in future Parrot Babysteps.</p>
