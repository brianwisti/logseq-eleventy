          <p>Last month I read an article about <a href="https://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/08/duotone-illustrations.html">duotone illustrations</a> and decided to try
a version of the technique myself someday. Today was that day.</p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duotone">Duotone</a> uses two colors — usually black and a color such as blue or red — to make an image. It was popular for a while in 20th Century illustration because it cost less than full color printing. Skilled duotone illustrators like <a href="https://americanillustration.org/project/mead-schaeffer/">Mead Schaeffer</a> produced visually arresting images.</p>

          <p>I wanted to manually create duotone images in sketch apps like Procreate. Time to describe what I came up with.</p>

          <p>This post isn’t a tutorial, but the information may be useful to you. For that matter it may be useful to <em>me</em>. That’s really what this whole site is about, after all: making life easier for future me, and hopefully maybe you too.</p>

          <p>I had a couple of self-imposed limitations while making this. I deliberately chose to only use flat color for this experiment — no shading to speak of. I also used a smaller canvas than usual. It wasn’t a technical limitation, but it did limit the detail I could put into the image.</p>

          <p>In retrospect, that’s probably a good thing for this experiment. I ended up with about 50 layers the way I put things together, and this might have slowed my iPad down with a large image.</p>

          <p>The first finished step is a solid black and white image. It started out as a
knotwork panel demonstration, but somewhere along the way I decided the panel
needed extras. Most of those extras came from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells">Tangles of Kells</a>.</p>
