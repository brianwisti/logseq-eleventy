          <p>My more focused approach to Taskwarrior is working well. I add a task when I get an idea, and mark it <code>done</code> sometime after I finish. Annotations let me add noteworthy details. Tags and projects help both for organizing tasks and describing them. A task bubbles up to the top of <code>task next</code> as I add more information to it.</p>

          <p>I created some tasks for playing with my Fitbit data and added relevant annotations. Taskwarrior follows a rule of “it must be important if you’re talking so much about it,”&quot; and dutifully puts those tasks high on the list.</p>

          <p>Thing is, right now I care more about fixing my music library. Long story, but the moral of <em>that</em> tale is be careful with Beets and the <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.6/plugins/duplicates.html">Duplicates</a> plugin. I have slightly different versions of the library on each of my machines, and a backup with all of the music but none of the Beets import information. I could make a project out of it, but it’s more of a thing I poke at when I can.</p>

          <p>Anyways — I want my <code>next</code> report to more closely resemble my current priorities. I can do that by manually setting <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/priority.html">Priority</a> for each of my tasks.</p>

          <p>Priority can be added to any task as an attribute, using <code>priority:</code> followed by the Priority you wish to assign. Priority also works as a filter for your reports. The default choices are <code>H</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>L</code>, and none at all — to remove a Priority.</p>

          <p>I see a new column reflecting that I now describe some tasks with Priority. Over on the end, <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/docs/urgency.html">Urgency</a> jumps for tasks with any Priority at all. <code>H</code> Priority tasks get a large boost. But what do these Priority values <em>mean</em>?</p>

          <p>I don’t need to think too much about priority when I’m just adding to the idea bucket. Probably a good idea to periodically review unprioritized tasks and assign a Priority or delete them if they won’t ever be worth my time.</p>
