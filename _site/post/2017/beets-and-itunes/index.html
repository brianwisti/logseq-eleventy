          <aside class="note"><header>note</header><p>I spent a full day trying to make JXA work for this. It didn’t. I kept crashing Script Editor with whimsical directives like <code>console.log(iTunes)</code>.

          <p>I rarely use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html">AppleScript</a>, so it took a combination of Web searching and guesswork to come up with this. <a href="https://dougscripts.com/itunes/2010/12/get-a-track-reference-from-a-file-path/">This post</a> from <a href="https://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php#whatsnew">Doug’s AppleScripts for iTunes</a> blog and this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/202504/searching-itunes-library-for-file-location#222834">Ask Different answer</a> got me most of the way there.
