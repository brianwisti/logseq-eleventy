The static HTML and associated files like images and stylesheets are then uploaded to an inexpensive Web host. Hey.  It works for me.

More importantly, I have been thinking about how <a href="http://beta.compass-style.org">Compass</a> would be a great thing to use for my site.

          <p>There are already awkward bits to the Rakefile as it is right now. I need to run two commands in order to build the site completely. Because <code>site-builder.py</code> also copies the site files to a new location, I must also remember to run the commands in the correct order. If I don’t, then the generated CSS will go into my site sources after the HTML has already been generated and copied.</p>

          <p>What if I made <code>:css</code> a <em>dependency</em> of <code>:html</code>? Rake would make sure that the <code>:css</code> task was executed before it tried to execute the <code>:html</code> task.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Now I can generate both CSS and HTML from a single Rake command. I am going to work a little bit on the styles, and to see if I notice any other little issues with my Rakefile.</p>

          <p>It would be nice if I could make the <code>rake</code> call a little shorter, though. I have a shortcut set up in <a href="/vim" class="page-link">Vim</a> that invokes Rake with a default argument. It would be nice to use that shortcut while I am working on coolnamehere.</p>

          <p>Rake already has rules for default tasks, actually. It looks for a task named “default” or <code>:default</code>. That makes sense. Let me set up a default task that depends on the <code>:html</code> task.</p>
