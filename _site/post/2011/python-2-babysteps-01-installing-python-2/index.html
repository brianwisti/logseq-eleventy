          <p>You need to <em>get</em> <a href="/python" class="page-link">Python</a> before you can <em>use</em> Python. There are many versions available, such as <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython">ActivePython</a>, <a href="http://jython.org/">Jython</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wikipage?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a>. They each offer distinct advantages. ActivePython offers commercial support. Jython runs on the <a href="/java" class="page-link">Java</a> platform, providing access to the underlying JVM and many support libraries. IronPython runs on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NET/">.NET</a> and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Python">Mono</a> platforms, providing access to <em>their</em> underlying virtual machine and support libraries.</p>

          <p>I decided to focus on the official release of Python rather than get overwhelmed by choice. You can probably follow along if you decide to install an alternate Python. I will provide notes where I can, but cannot make any guarantees about their accuracy. Check the documentation for your Python choice.</p>

          <p>Python 3 has been available for a while now, and is actually up to <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/3.2/">Python 3.2</a>. Why don’t I cover it in this Babystep? I would rather talk about the newest Python release. but that’s impractical. Many widely used libraries have not been updated so that they are compatible with the Python 3 series. Although the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are small, they add up for large projects like <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. I want you to be able to use your Python skills right away.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, the Python developers continue to support the 2.x line, and continue to release versions with fixes and new features for Python 2. If you started learning Python 2 today, it would continue to be useful for quite some time.</p>

          <p>Windows will ask you if you want to save the file or run it directly from the site. That’s up to you. If you have the disk space, and know how to find and run a file on your hard drive, I recommend you save the installer program to disk. That way you can redo an installation you messed up. On the other hand, if you don’t have much space on the computer, or you aren’t sure how to find a file once you’ve save it, you are probably better off opening the file straight from the site. I have screwed up so many installations that I pretty much automatically select “Save” when downloading an installer.</p>

          <p>Once you have downloaded the installer, you need to run it. If you told Windows that you wanted to open it from the current location, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you will need to find your file. You will probably find it in “Downloads”, within the “My Documents” section of the computer. Dig or search in your hard drive until you find the installer executable, named <code>Python-2.7.1.msi</code>. Double-click the icon to run the program, and you are on your way to installing Python!</p>

          <p>I’m going to skim through the next bit here, because most of the installation is   imply “Do you want me to install Python in folder X?” and “Do you want me to call it Python?” Most of the options you can safely run through by clicking “Next”, but stay alert for anything that you might want different from the defaults.</p>

          <p>Eventually, you are presented with a little progress bar while the installer puts all of the Python files where they belong.

          <p>That page has links to articles which discuss Python, tutorials, and comparisons to other languages. Python was largely written for educational environments: learning how to do things “the Python way” makes it easier to write clean, readable programs for any language. Plus, its flexibility makes it useful way past the classroom — unlike the stuff like Applesoft BASIC that <em>I</em> learned in class. There is nothing like spending years trying to forget what BASIC taught me about programming.</p>

          <p>IDLE is Python’s Integrated DeveLopment E&gt;nvironment.

I want to use that typed-in name in a moment, so I save the result in the variable <code>name</code>. A <em>variable</em> is basically just something you want the computer to remember so that you can use it later. What’s a <em>function</em>? Basically, it’s something you feed data into, and get data out of — kind of a mini-program in your program. That’s all we need to know for right now.</p>

          <p>When you press <code>[ENTER]</code> this time, you will be shown a prompt. In IDLE, this prompt shows up simply as some text printed out in the shell.</p>

          <p>I provide my name (“Brian”), and Python quietly saves that answer in the variable <code>name</code>, then waits for me to do something new. One of the things that confused me when I first tried <code>raw_input()</code> in the Python shell: how do I know that Python actually grabbed the name I gave? Well, it turns out that it’s easy enough to ask:</p>

          <p>When you want to get at a value that Python has stored for you, all you have to do is call it by name. In this case, I just wanted to print out the value of <code>name</code> — which was filled in when I typed my name at the prompt — and that’s exactly what I told Python to do. Pretty simple, yes?
Okay, so it has my name. What was I trying to do again? Oh yeah, the custom “Hello” thing. Let’s make it print “Hello, Brian” - or “Craig”, or “Susan”, or whatever name you gave to <code>raw_input()</code> …​ ummm …​ I lost myself again. Let me get back on track here.</p>

          <p>Every time you normally tell Python to print something, it will print that something out, and then start a new line. If you paste a comma onto the end of the thing you want to print, it’s just like a comma in conversation. It means that you’re pausing for air, and the sentence isn’t done yet. Instead of starting a new line, Python just inserts a space. The next thing that gets printed will show up on the same line.</p>

          <p>What if we wanted to be able to get that warm fuzzy feeling any time? It’s only two lines of code. We could probably enter that in the shell when we wanted some warm words. But there’s a school of programming that tells us Laziness is a virtue. Why write the same two lines again and again, when we could write them once, call it a program, and run that program anytime we felt blue?</p>

          <p>Well, they’re Python comments. Comments start from the character <code>#</code>, and extend to the end of the line that you wrote them on. Python ignores comments, which means that you can use them to explain what is going on in your code. Comments are good. When you come back to look at a complex script after several months, you might forget what some block of code does. Having the comments there to remind you will make it that much easier to sort everything out.</p>

          <p>Just try to match the header complexity to the program. Using this header for a program that consists of two lines of code might be a <em>little</em> bit of overkill. I usually start with something like the two-line header and expand it as I see fit.</p>

          <p>After you enter your script, you need to save it. That’s easy. Just go to the “File” menu and select “Save As…​” You will be shown a dialog that should look pretty familiar if you’ve ever worked with an editing program. Choose a directory to place your program, enter a name ending with <code>.py</code> to let your computer know that this is a Python file, and click “Save”. You have now saved your file.</p>

          <p>The Python installation automatically associates the <code>py</code> extension with Python program. That tells Windows that anything ending with <code>.py</code> should be handed over to Python. That means you can just double-click on <a href="http://hello.py">hello.py</a>, and Python will automatically run it. Unfortunately, that’s not very helpful for most of the stuff we’ll be writing. Try it yourself. You get a DOS box prompting you for your name, but the box disappears almost as soon as you press ENTER! That is kind of annoying.</p>

          <p>But there’s another trick which we can use until we’re writing more complex applications which can keep themselves open or don’t need a DOS box. Simply open your own DOS box (‘Start MenuAccessories|Command Prompt’), move to the directory that contains your script, and call Python yourself:</p>
