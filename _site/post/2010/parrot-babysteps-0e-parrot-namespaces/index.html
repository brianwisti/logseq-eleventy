          <p>Where was I? In <a href="/post/2010/parrot-babysteps-0d-the-spacetrade-project" class="page-link">post/2010/Parrot Babysteps 0d - The SpaceTrade Project</a> , I started working out some rough ideas for a version of the old school <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trader">Star Trader</a> game written in <a href="/parrot" class="page-link">Parrot</a> PIR. I made a quick description and sketched up a list of the  features that would need to be created. One of those features was an interactive shell to be used in developing and hacking on that Space Trade game. I wrote a simple shell that could be extended, making it easier to expand the capabilities of the shell in the future - or even use the shell in some completely unforeseen future application.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>I like that shell, but it is not perfect. Programming languages like Parrot support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace_(computer_science)">namespaces</a>, which you can think of as dictionaries that the language uses to look up variables and subroutines. My problem with the shell today revolves around the fact that every subroutine used in defining or extending the shell exists in the global namespace. They are available everywhere - in every line of code for the SpaceTrade game and anything that uses it. This may not be a huge problem by itself, because right now there are only a few subroutines. The number of subroutines will grow as the project evolves, however. This will have a couple of different effects.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>Subroutine names will be harder to remember, because the global namespace is one big bucket. I like to put related subroutines into little boxes so that I can focus on shell behavior when I’m looking at shell code, and game behavior when I’m looking at game code.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>Subroutine names could get rather contorted. What happens if I make Space Trade available, and against all odds it becomes a runaway success? Five, maybe even ten people download it and play it. It is likely that at least one of those people will want to write their own shell for the game. They will have to come up with some odd names for their shell code, such as <code>register_awesome_commands</code>, because I have selfishly used all the good names for my own shell.</p>

          <p>Namespaces provide a way to insulate the parts of a computer program from each other. The subroutines and variables defined in one namespace will not interfere with the subroutines and variables in another. This means that I can have my <code>register_default_commands</code> subroutine for my own shell, and you can have a  <code>register_default_commands</code> subroutine in your own shell, and they never need to know about each other. It does mean you must take extra steps if you want to use the subroutine from my package in your own code, or I must somehow provide a means to push the subroutines that I consider appropriate into your namespace. That is what <a href="https://github.com/parrot/parrot/blob/master/runtime/parrot/include/test_more.pir">Test::More</a> does. Defining something like that is an exercise in careful judgment and reasonable coding. In other words, we will not be doing that with SpaceTrade any time soon.</p>

          <p>Even though the SpaceTrade game has very little code right now, I want to put a little thought into organizing my namespaces before I create them.

          <p>Why do I say “SpaceTrade::Shell” rather than <code>['SpaceTrade';'Shell']</code> when talking about my namespace in this article? That is mainly because I am lazy. My fingers do not enjoy typing out all the characters to say <code>['SpaceTrace';'Shell']</code>, so I want to use a shorthand. “SpaceTrade::Shell” mimics a convention used by some Parrot programmers when talking about namespaces. It is a convention derived from the way that namespaces - or “packages” - are declared in <a href="/perl" class="page-link">Perl</a>, which is another language of choice for many Parrot developers. I will switch to another convention if I see one that is both widely used and easy to type.</p>

          <p>The tests pass, which is kind of cool. But <em>why</em> do they pass, if I have defined a namespace in <code>spacetrade.pir</code>? The tests should complain about missing subroutines if they are in a different namespace, right?</p>

          <p>Yes, that is right. However, the <code>.include</code> directive effectively dumps the code from your included file right where you put the directive. The tests exist in the <code>['SpaceTrade';'Shell']</code> namespace because we never indicated that we were moving onto a new one.</p>

          <p>That might even be okay for these tests. After all, they are just telling me that the shell subroutines work, not that namespace handling works. The SpaceTrade namespaces are going to get more cluttered as time goes on, though. I am going to be more explicit in the namespace handling for my tests in order to prepare for that clutter.</p>

The <code>get_global</code> opcode allows us to grab a variable from another namespace. We used it in to grab the <code>chomp</code> subroutine from the String::Utils namespace.

          <p>Up until now we have been using subroutine names when registering commands, but that is not going to work anymore. SpaceTrade no longer knows exactly where it should look for the subroutines with those names. Instead of names, let’s try using the subroutines themselves.</p>

          <p>That’s what the <code>does</code> check handles, incidentally. Right now we only know about subroutines, but later on we may get into strange creations that aren’t subroutines but can be invoked as if they were. From what the folks on IRC <code>#parrot</code> tell me, you would ask <code>command_sub</code> if it is invokable. All I know is that it worked and that I like the folks on <code>#parrot</code> very much.</p>

          <p>It is possible to set and get truly global variables with <code>get_root_global</code> and <code>set_root_global</code>, but I do not recommend it. What happens if you decide that the global <code>my_config</code> should be an Array instead of a Hash? Every piece of code that uses a global variable must be updated.
The same problem exists with package globals, even though it may be on a smaller scale. There’s a solution - or at least a way to make the problem even smaller. Whenever I see data and several subroutines that need to work on that data, I start to see objects.</p>
