          <p>I know - you <em>really</em> want to start adding features and working on cool new stuff. So do I. My workspace is scattered with half-completed steps that talked about adding new things and using new <a href="/parrot" class="page-link">Parrot</a> features. They kept breaking, though. They kept breaking because I wasn’t building from a stable, testable foundation. Today we’re going to get that step our of the way.</p>

          <p>It’s important to keep test files organized. One helpful approach is to think of each test as a story. This story describes a single specific thing we want the Stellar library to accomplish. All of the stories together provide a description of everything that users should be able to get from the library.</p>

          <p>I like to start with the smallest useful test story I can. For this code, I think that would be extracting the details about a single entry in the HYG catalog. The whole catalog isn’t even needed. We could get away with using the header line and the line containing a star’s details.</p>

          <p>Names for test files usually follow a common pattern. They start with a number and summarize what feature is being tested. What purpose does the number serve? Well, they are probably executed in the order that Parrot finds them, so that numbering provides a clue for test order. There are no promises about the order, though. The system looks at each story individually, and you should too. I like to think of the numbering as simply presenting the order that I came up with the stories. It provides a simple history of sorts. First I came up with that test, and I wrote this test after I was comfortable with the first.</p>

          <p>I am concerned about the heft of this test code. The concern is that I had to split the CSV text, extract star details, and summarize the star manually for each star string. Each of those times is an opportunity for me to make a mistake. I <em>think</em> I would like to have a subroutine which would take the header fields and a CSV line of star data, and return the extracted details. Let’s make a new test story for that.</p>

          <p>It is time to take a break. The script we wrote a while back is evolving into a tested library that can be used by others. Now that we have our foundation, we can start building up. Our next step will involve adding some simple search behavior to the library, and that is a significant improvement. For the moment, take a little time to relax.</p>
