          <p>It’s time to treat the star database like a database. Well, it’s time to treat it like something we can search, anyways. I know this is not a trivial task in <a href="/parrot" class="page-link">Parrot</a> , so the <a href="/post/2009/parrot-babysteps" class="page-link">post/2009/Parrot Babysteps</a> have been building up to it slowly. First, we figured out how to read from the database file and display its contents in a meaningful fashion. Second, we added subroutines to massage the data a little and produce some usable names for the thousands of stars in the database that do not have proper names. Then we suddenly spun off in a seemingly random direction, talking about testing and setting up larger projects. That was intentional, though. This sort of project requires more work in Parrot than in a language like Perl, due to Parrot’s lower-level nature. I wanted to be sure we could test this application as we add search functionality. We just pushed our script into the Stellar project to get that testing foundation.</p>

          <p>We could start by creating a simple search function, testing every line in the HYG Catalog and verifying the results by hand. That will obviously not work. Part of the reason we have been writing this is because the catalog is not easily read without a little computer help.</p>

          <p>It might be a better idea to take a smaller set and search against it. How small is good enough? A thousand? A hundred? Ten? We could reasonably start by searching a set of one star. It is certainly easy to manage. Okay, so we’ll start with a set of one star.</p>

          <p>What do I mean when I talk about searching through the catalog? The basic idea is that we have a catalog of stars and some conditions, like “the ProperName is ‘Sol’.” We build a list of matches by examining each star, seeing if the conditions are true for that star. If they are, then that star goes in the list of matches. Either way, we then move on to the next star.</p>

          <p>How do we determine if a single star is a match? Okay, we have a single star and some conditions. We determine if the star is a match by testing each condition. We can stop testing when we find a condition that is not true or we have run out of conditions to test. We know that this star is a match if every condition we tested was true.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of technical details that we would think about if this code was intended for use in the real world. Large match lists could use a lot of memory. The conditions would need to allow for ranges or approximate matches. Luckily, this code is not indented for use in the real world. I can be as clumsy as I want, as long as my program gives the right answer.</p>

          <p>It is a little easier now to tell what I am actually testing in this code. Good. I know I should be all methodical and orderly about checking my star fields, but I have not had enough sleep for that to be practical. Let’s check <code>Spectrum</code>.</p>

          <p>This works perfectly, but compare <code>check_star_spectrum</code> to <code>check_star_proper_name</code>. They are almost identical. In fact, the only difference between the code for the two subs is which field gets grabbed for <code>actual_value</code>.

          <p>All tests are still passing. You <em>are</em> working along with me and running tests, right? It’s time to decide what to do with those specific subs now that we have a nice general purpose field checker. You could argue that those subs should stick around but as wrappers that call <code>check_star_field</code>. That is entirely reasonable. I am comfortable using the general purpose sub as my main checker, though. I will delete the specific subs and their tests in my code.</p>

          <p>Parrot gives us two excellent modifiers that simplify the job of checking multiple fields. The <code>:slurpy</code> param modifier to effectively say “Oh, there might be some other params. Just put them in an array.” The flip side of that is the <code>:flat</code> modifier in subroutine calls, which lets us say “Oh, I have this array of stuff.

          <p>I tried to make it clear what was going on the comments. <code>check_star</code> is given a star and a handful of conditions. It only cares about the first condition, and stuffs the rest into <code>extra_fields</code>. If the first condition fails, we’re done. There’s no point in checking any more fields, so jump down to return the failure. If there are no other conditions to check - which we determine by looking at the size of <code>extra_fields</code> - we return the result, which should be a success.</p>

          <p>If there <em>are</em> more conditions to check, we call <code>check_star</code> again, using the star and the conditions we had stuffed into <code>extra_fields</code>. That goes through the same process of testing and looking for extra conditions until it has completed the last test. The result of all the completed tests is handed back to <code>check_star</code>, which then hands it back to us.</p>

          <p>This process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">recursion</a> - solving a complex problem by breaking it down into small problems - is common in many programming languages, so it is supported by Parrot. After all, Parrot is supposed to be used for creating new languages. It is not just for browsing some guy’s star catalog.</p>

          <p>The “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail call</a>” pattern of evaluating a sub and immediately returning its result is so common that Parrot provides the <code>.tailcall</code> directive to optimize its behavior. <code>.tailcall</code> essentially tells Parrot to immediately return the result of evaluating the sub rather than storing it in memory. It may not do much in a case like <code>check_star</code>, but you should see a difference in complex problems.</p>

          <p>We can now examine multiple fields to determine if a star matches a description we’ve provided. Along the way, we explored subroutine parameters. We learned how to make a parameter optional. We learned how to grab all of a subroutine’s params and stuff them into a list. We also learned how to paste the contents of a list onto the parameters of a subroutine call. We even dabbled in recursion, the fine art of breaking a big problem down with small solutions.</p>
