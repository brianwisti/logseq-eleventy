          <p><a href="/post/2009/parrot-babysteps" class="page-link">post/2009/Parrot Babysteps</a> continues. We have accomplished the hard part with our star catalog: checking a single star to see if it has the traits we’re looking for. Today we just have to use that logic to search a set of stars. First we’ll examine a handpicked selection. Guess what happens after that? We finally get back into the full <a href="http://www.astronexus.com">HYG Catalog</a> and search for stars from the command line. That’s right. After all this work, <code>stellar</code> grows up and becomes an application.</p>

          <p>The first thing that’s tripping me up is how to set up the catalog itself. You know the “set of stars” I was talking about? The easy way to do this from a test is to have a few CSV strings for some sample stars, apply <code>extract_from_csv</code> to each of them, push each star into an array, then search through the array. Thing is, I <em>know</em> that this is not going to be acceptable when I get to the real data. I expect this application to be one where you run it from the command line, using your search conditions as command line arguments. Loading all the data before searching it takes time. I should write this code so that it searches while reading in data. That would be much faster.</p>

    <section class="block">
      
        

        
          <p>On the other hand, what if I add an interactive prompt to this application later? Loading the full catalog into memory before applying searches could be faster in the long run compared to reading the data file for every search.</p>

          <p>That is trying to predict the future, though. I know how I want to use this catalog today. I want to run a search and see the results as soon as the application knows about them.</p>

          <p>#+BEGIN_NOTE
I will share a secret. I spent a day writing the “load then search” approach to building the catalog. Guess what? It is unbearably slow at my current Parrot skill level. I am confident that this is only
slow because my code overall is simplistic. Maybe I can revisit this idea after learning more about Parrot.

After it defines a star from the current line, it asks <code>check_star</code> to compare that star to the set of conditions it has been given.

          <p><code>stellar</code> has reached a major milestone. When I started fiddling with the <a href="http://astronexus.com/node/34">HYG Database</a>, I wanted to write a command-line Parrot tool that could look up stars based on specific fields. This step gives us that ability. I admit that a lot more could be done. For example, it only does exact matches. You can easily find a star that is <code>108.108108108108</code> light years away, but not stars that are roughly <code>108</code> light years away. And forget about finding stars within 20 light years.</p>
