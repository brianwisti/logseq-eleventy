          <p>No not for the disease. Sheesh. For the new social rules. They gave us an  acceptable excuse to keep our wedding a small affair.</p>

          <p>A <em>very</em> small affair. Five of us and four — her <a href="https://twitter.com/qlitterbang">eldest daughter</a>, <a href="https://www.shellybedsaul.com">my mom</a> (subliminal message: BUY THEIR ART) plus a couple friends who couldn’t be there because quarantine — watching on Facebook group video chat. Might have added more, but the technical issues were complicated enough as it was.</p>

          <p>One of our friends got ordained so she could officiate. We wouldn’t have to worry about the courthouses closing! The same friend was sort of an anti-chaperone at an early event. She made sure we were dancing close enough and that our hands were outside the Respectful First Dance Zone.</p>

          <p>And yesterday she made sure we would be able to get married. It’s the circle of life. Or something. It’s very sweet is what it is.</p>
