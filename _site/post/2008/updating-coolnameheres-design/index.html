          <p>I’ve been using a tweaked version of the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/2448">Greenery</a> template from <a href="http://oswd.org">OSWD</a> for a couple of years now. I think it’s time for a change. This time I actually concocted my own design using one of my photos and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">Yahoo’s YUI</a>. I had so much fun with YUI on <a href="http://greenlakeumc.org">my church site</a> that I had to try it out on my own site.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of things I liked about this design. The grass image dividing the columns gave the site an attractive and natural touch that had been missing before. On the other hand, I felt the need to tweak it so that it would work in all the browsers I used. It’s nice, though. Much better than the designs I had been coming up with on my own.</p>

          <p>The new design has been widely praised by my sample group of two incredibly non-biased people: my wife and my brother. Okay, I will concede that they may have a bias. I like it in general, though. It’s very … Seattle. Clouds, water, scotch bloom.</p>

          <p>The design is still in progress. For starters, I <em>hate</em> the navtree menu. That navtree is starting to look a little cumbersome, actually, and is making me rethink how I want to handle navigation through the site. Maybe a simple subpage listing such as the one generated by ZenWeb. I’m also looking at new publishing options, and the one that is most attractive to me right now is <a href="http://www.blosxom.com">Blosxom</a>. It’s relatively old. It is also ridiculously easy to use and fairly
straightforward to enhance.</p>

          <p>Oh, and I need to sort through the CSS, and probably the content itself. Oh well, at least all the pages are in order.</p>
