          <p>I took all my blog posts since 2000 — since before the site was a blog — put them in <a href="/obsidian" class="page-link">Obsidian</a>, extracted note cards for recurring content, and smashed the whole thing into a new iteration of <a href="/random-geekery" class="page-link">Random Geekery</a>.</p>

          <p>I tried sharing <a href="/my-public-brain" class="page-link">My Public Brain</a> a couple times. It didn’t work out. Maintaining an extra site added personal friction, and I ended up ignoring all of it. I wanted to keep trying, though. My first site <a href="/coolnamehere" class="page-link">coolnamehere</a> was an organized collection of notes on topics as I learned them. I’ve mostly been blogging the last decade, but missed the ability to link back to topic notes from my posts.</p>

          <p>At the very least, having dedicated topic cards means fewer places to update external links. That can save a few minutes of effort over a couple decades, for sure.</p>

          <p>Initially I pulled the vault into an <a href="/astro" class="page-link">Astro</a> site with  <a href="https://typestrong.org/ts-node/">ts-node</a>. It sort of worked. Came into some issues with <code>ts-node</code> on very fresh <a href="/nodejs" class="page-link">Node.js</a> though, and decided to see if someone had already figured out Obsidian export.</p>

          <p>Turns out, yes. <a href="/obsidian-export" class="page-link">obsidian-export</a> handles internal links and provides some starter template logic for working with <a href="/hugo" class="page-link">Hugo</a>. I’m setting Astro aside for the moment. Sticking with Hugo made cleanup easier, since I no longer had to care about shortcodes.</p>

          <p>Got a Perl script for backlinks and a Python script for processing Obsidian Markdown rules that <code>obsidian-export</code> didn’t cover. Not happy with either of those scripts yet, so I won’t go into detail about them here. The Perl script finds backlinks and puts them in a data file for quicker backlink handling at site build time, and the Python script currently does some regular expression handling to identify special markup and transform it.</p>

          <p>I pulled in my automated tests from the current site iteration. I really should talk more about those tests at some point. They mostly check for structural issues with <code>markdownlint</code> and broken internal links.</p>
