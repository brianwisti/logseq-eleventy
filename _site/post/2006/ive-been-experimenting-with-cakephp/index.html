          <p>I’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> over the last couple of weeks for a project. It’s definitely not <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>, but it has a lot of charm. This library provides a MVC system for <a href="/php" class="page-link">PHP</a> applications, but the really interesting thing is that you can just drop it onto your Web server space with no fuss or bother. You don’t even have to worry about clever mod_rewrite rules if you don’t want to.</p>

          <p>Since CakePHP is so accessible, I thought it would be fun to explore the framework a little bit more, and document what’s going on here. Now, I’m not the greatest at remembering to update this blog, but I’ll do my best.</p>

          <p>My goal is straightforward: create a forum application, similar in purpose to <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a>. I’m sure it has already been done, but I’m in this strictly for the educational exercise.</p>

          <p>The first task - assuming you already have Web space with support for PHP and MySQL - is to get CakePHP. That’s easy enough. Just grab the latest archive from the download section of the CakePHP site, and unpack it to your server space. I’m fond of using my personal machine as a development site, so I won’t be worrying about issues like uploading or editing remote files.</p>

          <p>Okay, there are much safer approaches to setting things up, but I am only doing quick and dirty development on my home machine.</p>

          <p>Next I need to manage the database connections. CakePHP uses PHP code for configuration, following along with the Rails idea of “convention over configuration.” The theory is that a handful of PHP files are easier to sort through than a handful of XML configuration files.</p>

          <p>Configuration files are kept in <code>cakebb/app/config</code>. The first one I’ll be looking at is database.php, except that there is no <code>database.php</code> when Cake is first extracted. We have a file <code>database.php.default</code> instead. I’ll move it over to <code>database.php</code> so that Cake has something to look at on startup.</p>
