          <p>A mountain of standards and specifications have piled on top of <a href="/xml" class="page-link">XML</a> over the  years, but the core language is still pretty easy to get started in. Because it  is a markup language rather than a programming language, there aren’t as many  new concepts to learn. If you’ve learned HTML in the past, then XML will be  familiar.</p>

          <p>I usually try to scatter my “Learning” sections across several pages, so that  each major idea can get its own space. XML is different, though. Core XML  really is a simple creature, and I think I can get the most important ideas out in one page. Let’s see if that will happen.</p>

          <p>A text editor is all you need to get started in XML. However, you will probably want to look at your XML as something besides markup. The best solution for that would be a Web browser that understands XML. Both Internet Explorer and <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a> can read and display XML documents in a pleasant format. I strongly prefer Firefox because its XML capabilities are
very strong.</p>

          <p>The very first line is called the <em>prolog</em>. The browser relies on the presence of that prolog to recognize an XML file.

          <p>The document itself consists of the <em>root element</em>. If you’ve ever written HTML, then this “element” business will be no problem for you. <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the root element of a HTML file, and the rest of your page goes inside. If you haven’t written HTML, then elements can look a little intimidating. Let’s talk about them in a little more detail.</p>

          <p>Elements are what give an XML document its structure. They have three parts: a beginning, an end, and everything in between. The beginning consists of a name and maybe some <em>attributes</em> wrapped in <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters. The end is the name prefixed by the / character and wrapped in <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters. The beginning and end are often referred to as the <em>opening tag</em> and the <em>closing tag</em>. In between them, you can find anything: text, <em>entities</em>, <em>comments</em>, <em>processing instructions</em>, <em>non-parsed data</em>, and more <em>elements</em>.</p>

          <p>Even though you <em>can</em> find anything inside an element, the XML language you are using probably has specific rules for what can be contained inside each particular element. For example, in XHTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> should only be inside of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p>

          <p>Sometimes there is no “in-between” content for an element. The creators of the XML specification realized that it would get tiring to enter <code>&lt;element&gt;&lt;/element&gt;</code> all the time. Those extra characters can also add up, taking up precious bandwidth when sending large XML documents to large numbers of machines. So, they added a special rule. If the element is empty, you can suffix the opening tag with a / character, and leave off the closing tag.</p>

          <p>Plain old text is pretty straightforward: you’re reading some right now. There is one little quirk that you need to deal with, though. What do you do when you want to display a less-than or greater-than symbol in your text? Well, that’s where <em>entity references</em> come in.</p>

          <p>Using an entity reference is a little more complicated than what you’ve dealt with so far, but let’s get into it. An entity is either a special name or a numeric value. You reference the entiy by prefixing it with the <code>&amp;</code> character and suffixing it with the <code>;</code> character. If your entity is a numeric value, it must be prefixed with the # character befor referencing it.</p>

          <p>You probably won’t see this much when you’re getting started, but I thought I would mention it anyways. Non-Parsed Data is content that … well … you don’t want parsed. It can hold anything, including XML. I’ve used it to hold Python code for projects. It doesn’t matter what the section holds, because the browser will ignore it unless told to do otherwise.</p>

          <p>I was going to ignore these, since they are a relic of XML’s SGML history. The truth is that you are going to see these a lot when editing XML documents. Web browsers in particular often rely on the DTD when deciding how to interpret an XHTML file. DTD declarations are used to define the rules of the XML language you are using or to point to the location of these rules. Here’s a sample DTD declaration, which is pointing to the Transitional XHTML rules.</p>

          <p>Using a DTD declaration in your XML is - at this stage in your knowledge - just a matter of copying and pasting a sample. You can always pursue DTD mastery yourself if you like.</p>

          <p>If you are used to HTML, then you may also be used to seeing some sloppy markup. Authors used opening tags with no closing tag, or mixed up the order that tags were closed. HTML browsers were forgiving, but XML is not. All elements must be opened and closed or shown to be empty. Elements always contain elements. You must close your elements in the opposite order you opened them.</p>

          <p>You’ve just dipped your toes in the deep and murky waters of XML. There is still <em>so</em> much more to discover. I wanted you to be able to recognize an XML document in the wild, and know enough to create your own simple documents. You still need to learn how to create your own language so that your XML is completely valid. Both of us need to study XPath, XML-Schema, and the many other standards which have evolved over the years.</p>
