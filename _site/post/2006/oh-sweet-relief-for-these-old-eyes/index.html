          <p>Can you tell it’s been a slow week at work? We recently wrapped up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070209071916/http://my.bigfishgames.com/bwisti">My Bigfishgames</a>, which has been a <em>major</em> project. I was part of the team that put it together. Most of my contributions were on behind the scenes code, though. You won’t be seeing any pages put together by me. Well, except for my own Bigfishgames page that I linked to there.</p>

          <p>Today I took a little time to update <a href="/post/2001/python-babysteps-tutorial" class="page-link">post/2001/Python Babysteps Tutorial</a> to reflect the newer release of Python. While I was at it, I realized that I desperately needed the text to be a more readable size. A few adjustments were made, and now the font size is based on whatever the default for your browser is. Almost all pixel-level CSS rules were changed or removed. I had to switch from a <code>div</code> based layout to a table-based layout, though. It was the easiest way to keep the menu from dropping off the page when the window was resized.</p>

          <p>Pragmatism must rule over idealism today. But I’m just happy I can read my site again. 11 pixel text on a 15&quot; screen showing 1400×1050 pixels wasn’t working for me.</p>
