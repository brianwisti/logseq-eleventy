          <p><a href="/raku" class="page-link">Raku</a> has been a long time coming. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060813074835/http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/apo/A01.html">very long time</a> indeed. For a few years, Perl developers heard about how great Perl 6 was going to be, but didn’t see any sign of code. Sure, Perl 6 was going to be huge, but <em>when</em> were we going to be able to play with it on our own? A beta build is supposedly due sometime in 2007 or so, but for now we have the magical toy that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060813074835/http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a>. Pugs is the brainchild of Audrey Tang, who deserves heaps of praise for such an ambitious undertaking. We can use Pugs to get a feel for the newness of Perl 6 without waiting for the mythical beta build.</p>

          <p>There are a few ways you can get a copy of Pugs:</p>

          <p>You can download the latest release and build it yourself, which I haven’t quite managed to do yet. It must be emphasized once again that if the moon and stars are not perfectly aligned, I am a <em>very</em> impatient guy.</p>

          <p>You can grab a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060813074835/http://pugs.kwiki.org/?PugsBinaries">binary copy</a> and install it that way. That’s what I ended up doing, choosing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060813074835/http://jnthn.net/perl6">JonathonWorthington’s</a> builds from the SVN repository. It’s up to date and seems to work for me.</p>

          <p>Okay, so there aren’t a lot of ways to get Pugs, but there are a couple for you. Pugs is not for the complete programming novice. You are messing with a language that doesn’t exist yet, after all!</p>

          <p>So until Perl 6 is in beta, any time I’m talking about Perl 6 I’m <em>probably</em> talking about Pugs. Or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060813074835/http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>. But probably Pugs.</p>
