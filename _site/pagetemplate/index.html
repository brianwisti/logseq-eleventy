          <p>PageTemplate was a <em class="link-missing">ruby</em> package which allowed you to utilize text templates for your Web projects. It was mainly intended for use in a CGI environment, but designed to be helpful in a broad range of similar applications. It was inspired by, yet almost entirely unlike, the <a href="http://html-template.sourceforge.net/">HTML::Template</a> package available for Perl. It has many features in common with other templating engines:</p>

          <p>PageTemplate is a personal project, which means that it’s not a commercial product. As much as I hope that it’s functional and stable on your computer, I can’t make any promises. If installing PageTemplate levels New Jersey, there’s nothing I can do about it. This is my version of the standard “no warranty” warranty.</p>

          <p>Last but not least, PageTemplate is not HTML::Template. HTML::Template has been growing and evolving for years, while PageTemplate was the result of a week alone with 5 pounds of coffee.

          <p>Brian has been a fan of Perl’s HTML::Template package for a long time, and he missed its robust usefulness whenever using a language that isn’t Perl. After delving deeper into other languages, he thought it might be fun to make some of that utility available in Ruby. It would give Brian a decent-sized personal project, which would stretch his skills with project development and unit testing. Plus, if a templating system was available, maybe he wouldn’t miss Perl so badly.</p>

          <p>Once the code started taking shape, though, he decided that he wanted this to be useful for other people. “Download and use” kind of useful. Greg Millam found PageTemplate to be <em>so</em> useful that he opted to join in the development process and add loads of new features. PageTemplate has continued to be used by a small but apparently loyal group of people, despite Brian and Greg’s periodic hibernation. The continued contributions of Greg Millam have made PageTemplate a powerful tool for Web development rather than the mild distraction it started out as.</p>
