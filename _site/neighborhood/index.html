          <p>I started asking everyone to <a href="/follow" class="page-link">Follow</a> me a long time ago. But there has a big gap on this site: who <em>else</em> should you follow? Who do <em>I</em> follow?</p>

          <p>Well here you go. This page lists the sites that I regularly check via <a href="https://fraidyc.at">Fraidycat</a>. Fraidycat uses a simpler organization than some other readers: there’s a topic or section, usually described with an icon. Those sections are then divided into how frequently you want to check them.</p>

          <p>The listing below is a little raw — just what Fraidycat provided in export. They’re also incomplete. I pulled a couple of my data feeds and NSFW blogs where they forget to warn you that they’re not work safe.</p>

          <p>It’s also incomplete because I’m still pulling in the sites I usually follow via Twitter.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless! I wanted <em>something</em> I could point you to for suggestions. In an earlier age, this page would be “blogroll” but “neighborhood” describes it a little better for me. Nobody paid or asked to be on this list. Many of these folks are friends or at least people and projects I appreciate. My neighbors.</p>
