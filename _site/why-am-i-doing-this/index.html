          <p>My first site <a href="/coolnamehere" class="page-link">coolnamehere</a> was an organized collection of notes. My current site <a href="/random-geekery" class="page-link">Random Geekery</a>  has basically just been a blog for its first ten years. But blogs alone are too ephemeral. Everything is ephemeral, but a blog — my blog — has been about what has my attention a specific point in time. Once my attention moves on, I don’t track a post’s contents too closely.</p>

          <p>Nothing wrong with that, but I want some anchors for my attention. And since folks used to enjoy the notes in coolnamehere, I’ll share those anchors with you.</p>

          <p>Closest I’ve got to a regret is that I started with a blank slate — I started with just the Web pages I already published, and extracted short cards for recurring topics as I noticed them. So I apologize for the many shortcomings in these notes. But hey they’re my notes. They’re for tracking what’s interesting to me, in a way that’s interesting to me.</p>
